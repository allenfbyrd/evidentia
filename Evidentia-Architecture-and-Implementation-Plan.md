## 1. Executive Summary

Evidentia is an open-source, Python-first GRC tool that provides five core capabilities:

1. **Control Gap Analysis** — Compare an organization's current control inventory against one or more compliance frameworks (NIST 800-53, SOC 2, ISO 27001, CIS Controls, CMMC, PCI DSS) and produce a prioritized gap report with cross-framework efficiency opportunities.
2. **AI Risk Statement Generation** — Given a gap report and system context, generate NIST SP 800-30-compliant risk statements with structured threat/vulnerability/impact analysis and remediation recommendations using any LLM provider.
3. **Automated Evidence Collection** — Continuously collect compliance evidence from cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP), identity providers (Okta), source control (GitHub), and map evidence artifacts to specific framework controls.
4. **AI Evidence Validation** — Assess collected evidence for sufficiency, relevance, currency, and completeness using LLM-powered analysis (including vision models for screenshots and PDFs).
5. **Integration Outputs** — Push gaps as tickets to Jira or ServiceNow, export reports as OSCAL Assessment Results, CSV, Markdown, or JSON for auditor tooling.

### Why Evidentia Exists

Existing open-source GRC tools fall into two camps: full-platform solutions (CISO Assistant, Eramba) that require deployment infrastructure and database setup, or point tools that solve one narrow problem. Evidentia occupies the middle ground — a **composable Python library** that a security engineer can `pip install` and start using in five minutes, scaling from single-developer CLI usage to team-wide REST API deployment without architecture changes.

### Core Value Proposition

- **One control implementation satisfies multiple framework requirements.** Evidentia's cross-framework mapping engine makes this visible and actionable.
- **Evidence collection is automated, mapped, and validated.** Not just collected — assessed for audit readiness.
- **Every output is auditor-friendly.** Timestamped, source-attributed, versioned, OSCAL-compatible.
- **Zero-to-productive in under 5 minutes.** No database, no Kubernetes, no config files required for basic use.

## 2. Design Principles

Every architectural and implementation decision in this document traces back to one or more of the following ten principles. They are non-negotiable constraints, not aspirational goals.

### Principle 1: Composable, Not Monolithic

Each of the five core capabilities is independently installable and usable. A user can `pip install evidentia-core` and use only the gap analyzer without pulling in AI dependencies, evidence collectors, or integration clients. The package structure enforces this:

| Package | Depends On | Provides |
|---|---|---|
| `evidentia-core` | pydantic, pyyaml, oscal-pydantic | Data models, catalog loading, gap analysis engine |
| `evidentia-ai` | evidentia-core, litellm, instructor | Risk statement generator, evidence validator, narrative generator |
| `evidentia-collectors` | evidentia-core, boto3, PyGithub, etc. | Evidence collection agents |
| `evidentia-integrations` | evidentia-core, jira, servicenow-api | Jira and ServiceNow output clients |
| `evidentia` (meta-package) | All of the above + typer, fastapi | CLI, REST API, and full installation |

**Rationale:** GRC tools are adopted incrementally. A security engineer evaluating the tool wants to try gap analysis first, not install AWS SDK dependencies they don't need. Composability also reduces the attack surface — teams that don't use AI features never install LLM libraries.

### Principle 2: Library-First, CLI-Second, REST API-Third

The Python library is the canonical interface. The CLI is a thin wrapper around the library. The REST API is a thin wrapper around the CLI logic (which calls the library). This layered architecture ensures:

- **Behavior consistency:** All three interfaces produce identical outputs for identical inputs.
- **Testability:** Unit tests exercise the library directly. Integration tests exercise the CLI. API tests are thin because the API delegates to the library.
- **Embeddability:** Security teams can import Evidentia into their existing Python automation, CI/CD pipelines, or Jupyter notebooks without running a server.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            REST API (FastAPI)            │  Layer 3: HTTP interface
│      Pydantic request/response models   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│              CLI (Typer)                 │  Layer 2: Terminal interface
│         Rich-formatted output           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│        Python Library (Core)            │  Layer 1: Canonical interface
│  Pydantic models, business logic, I/O   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Principle 3: OSCAL as the Exchange Standard

All internal data models map cleanly to OSCAL (Open Security Controls Assessment Language) concepts:

| Evidentia Concept | OSCAL Equivalent |
|---|---|
| `ControlCatalog` | `catalog` |
| `ControlInventory` | `component-definition` |
| `GapAnalysisReport` | `assessment-results` |
| `EvidenceArtifact` | `observation` within `assessment-results` |
| `RiskStatement` | `risk` within `assessment-results` |
| Framework crosswalk | `profile` with `import` and `modify` |

Output is always OSCAL-compatible, even if input is not. When a user provides a CSV inventory, Evidentia normalizes it to internal Pydantic models that can serialize to OSCAL JSON at any point.

**Rationale:** OSCAL is a NIST-published, machine-readable standard for security control information. Government agencies (FedRAMP), defense contractors (CMMC), and an increasing number of private-sector organizations require OSCAL-formatted artifacts. By using OSCAL as the internal exchange format, Evidentia outputs are directly consumable by the OSCAL ecosystem (OSCAL CLI, Trestle, Lula, GovReady).

### Principle 4: No Database Required for Core Use

Default operation uses structured YAML and JSON files. Everything is git-friendly — control inventories, gap reports, evidence bundles, and risk statements are stored as human-readable files that can be version-controlled, diff'd, and reviewed in pull requests.

```
.evidentia/
├── inventories/
│   └── 2026-04-05_controls.yaml
├── reports/
│   └── 2026-04-05_gap-analysis.json
├── evidence/
│   ├── 2026-04-05_aws-config.json
│   ├── 2026-04-05_github-repos.json
│   └── 2026-04-05_okta-iam.json
├── risks/
│   └── 2026-04-05_risk-statements.json
└── validated/
    └── 2026-04-05_validated-bundle.json
```

Optional persistence backends for team use:
- **SQLite:** Single-file database for local persistence with query capabilities. No server process.
- **PostgreSQL:** Full relational database for multi-user team deployments with concurrent access, RBAC, and audit logging.

The storage backend is selected via `evidentia.yaml` and abstracted behind a `StorageBackend` interface so all business logic is storage-agnostic.

### Principle 5: LLM-Agnostic

All AI features use LiteLLM (unified interface to 100+ LLM providers) and Instructor (structured output extraction using Pydantic models). The model is configurable at three levels:

1. **Environment variable:** `EVIDENTIA_LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o`
2. **Config file:** `llm.model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"` in `evidentia.yaml`
3. **Per-call override:** `--model ollama/llama3.3` on CLI commands

Supported providers (via LiteLLM):
- OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini)
- Anthropic (Claude Sonnet, Claude Haiku)
- Google (Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini Flash)
- Azure OpenAI (any deployed model)
- AWS Bedrock (Claude, Titan)
- Ollama (any local model — Llama 3.3, Mistral, Qwen, etc.)
- Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (vLLM, LiteLLM Proxy, etc.)

**Rationale:** Enterprise customers have existing LLM contracts and data residency requirements. A GRC tool that only works with OpenAI is a non-starter for organizations using Azure OpenAI or running local models for data sovereignty.

### Principle 6: Framework-Agnostic Internal Model

Evidentia does not model each framework as a separate system. Instead, it uses a unified control model where one `ControlImplementation` can map to requirements across multiple frameworks simultaneously. The cross-framework mapping engine (powered by NIST-published crosswalks) answers questions like:

- "If I implement NIST AC-2 (Account Management), which SOC 2, ISO 27001, and CIS Controls requirements does that also satisfy?"
- "What is the minimum set of controls I need to implement to achieve compliance with NIST 800-53 Moderate AND SOC 2 AND ISO 27001?"

This cross-framework efficiency is a first-class concept, surfaced in gap reports as "efficiency opportunities" — controls that satisfy three or more framework requirements simultaneously.

### Principle 7: Reliability Over Breadth

Evidentia ships with fewer, more reliable integrations rather than 200 fragile connectors. Each collector includes:

- **Connection health monitoring:** `check_connection()` verifies connectivity, authentication, and permissions before attempting collection.
- **Retry logic:** Exponential backoff with jitter for transient failures. Configurable max retries.
- **Connection status reporting:** The `/health` endpoint and `collect check-connections` CLI command report the real-time status of every configured collector.
- **Graceful degradation:** If one collector fails, others continue. The report notes which collectors succeeded and which failed.
- **Rate limiting:** Respect API rate limits for each integration (GitHub, Okta, AWS).

**Initial collectors (Phase 2):** AWS (Config, Security Hub, IAM, CloudTrail, Audit Manager), GitHub (repos, actions), Okta (IAM, MFA, policies).  
**Secondary collectors (Phase 2 late):** Azure (Policy, Defender, Entra ID), GCP (Security Command Center, Org Policy).

### Principle 8: Portable Deployment

Three supported deployment modes, all from the same codebase:

| Mode | Command | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| **pip install** | `pip install evidentia` | Developer workstation, CI/CD pipelines, Python scripts |
| **Docker** | `docker run ghcr.io/evidentia/evidentia:latest` | Server deployment, team use |
| **Homebrew** (future) | `brew install evidentia` | macOS developer convenience |

No Kubernetes required. No Helm charts. No Terraform modules. A single Docker container with a mounted config file and environment variables is the production deployment model.

### Principle 9: Auditor-Friendly Output

Every output artifact includes:

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `id` | Unique identifier (UUID v4) for traceability |
| `created_at` / `generated_at` | ISO 8601 timestamp |
| `created_by` / `generated_by` | Source attribution (collector name, user email, or "evidentia-ai") |
| `version` | Evidentia version that generated the output |
| `content_hash` | SHA-256 hash for tamper detection (evidence artifacts) |
| `source_system` | Origin system (e.g., "aws-config", "github", "manual-upload") |

Export formats: JSON (default), CSV (for spreadsheet users), Markdown (for documentation), OSCAL Assessment Results (for government/defense audits).

### Principle 10: Progressive Enhancement

Evidentia works with zero configuration for basic operations:

```bash
# Zero-config usage: analyze a control inventory against default frameworks
evidentia gap analyze --inventory my-controls.yaml

# Add one config option: specify frameworks
evidentia gap analyze --inventory my-controls.yaml --frameworks soc2-tsc,iso27001-2022

# Add AI: generate risk statements (requires LLM API key)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
evidentia risk generate --context system-context.yaml --gaps report.json

# Add evidence collection (requires cloud credentials)
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
evidentia collect run --collectors aws --frameworks nist-800-53-mod

# Add integrations (requires Jira credentials)
export JIRA_SERVER=https://my-company.atlassian.net
evidentia gap push-jira --report report.json --project SEC
```

Complexity is always opt-in. A `evidentia.yaml` config file is only needed when the user wants persistent configuration.

| `equivalent` | Source and target controls have essentially the same requirements |
| `related` | Controls address the same security domain but with different scope or specificity |
| `partial` | Source control partially addresses target requirement (or vice versa) |
| `superset` | Source control fully encompasses the target requirement plus additional requirements |

"""Multi-format control inventory parser.

Supports four input formats with auto-detection:
1. Evidentia YAML (preferred)
2. CSV with fuzzy header matching
3. OSCAL component definition JSON
4. CISO Assistant JSON export

1. Check file extension (.yaml/.yml → YAML, .csv → CSV, .json → JSON)
2. If JSON: check for "component-definition" key → OSCAL
3. If JSON: check for "ciso_assistant" or "framework" key → CISO Assistant
4. If YAML: check for "controls:" key → Evidentia
5. If CSV: map columns with fuzzy matching on standard header names

"""

RISK_STATEMENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are an expert cybersecurity risk analyst specializing in NIST Risk Management \
Framework (RMF) risk assessments. You produce risk statements following the \
structure defined in NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1, "Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments."

Your task is to generate a structured risk statement for a specific control gap \
identified during a gap analysis. The risk statement must be:

1. **Specific and measurable.** Never use vague language like "potential impact" or \
"may cause harm." Instead, reference specific data types, record counts, system names, \
regulatory consequences, and dollar amounts where possible.

2. **Structured per NIST SP 800-30.** Every risk statement must decompose into:
   - **Asset**: The specific system, data, or function at risk
   - **Threat source**: Who or what could exploit the vulnerability
   - **Threat event**: What they would do (specific technical action)
   - **Vulnerability**: The weakness that enables the threat (tied to the control gap)
   - **Predisposing conditions**: Environmental factors that increase likelihood
   - **Likelihood**: Rated on a 5-point scale with specific rationale
   - **Impact**: Rated on a 5-point scale with specific rationale
   - **Risk level**: Derived from likelihood × impact per NIST risk matrix

3. **Actionable.** Include specific NIST 800-53 control IDs that would mitigate the risk, \
and ordered remediation steps.

4. **Honest about uncertainty.** If the system context doesn't provide enough information \
to make a precise assessment, say so in the rationale rather than fabricating specifics.

NIST SP 800-30 Risk Matrix (for determining risk_level from likelihood × impact):
- Very High × Very High/High = Critical
- High × Very High/High = Critical
- High × Moderate = High
- Moderate × Very High/High = High
- Moderate × Moderate = Medium
- Low × Very High/High = Medium
- Low × Moderate/Low = Low
- Very Low × any = Low (or Informational)

CRITICAL RULES:
- Only reference NIST 800-53 control IDs that actually exist. Do not fabricate control IDs.
- Rate likelihood and impact independently — do not conflate them.
- The vulnerability field MUST directly reference the control gap provided.
- remediation_priority: 1 = most urgent, 5 = least urgent.

## 9. Phase 3: Evidence Validator + Integration Outputs

### 9.1 Evidence Validator (evidentia_ai/evidence_validator/validator.py)

```python
"""AI-powered evidence sufficiency validator.

Assesses collected evidence for:
1. Relevance: Does the evidence relate to the claimed control?
2. Sufficiency: Does it demonstrate compliance?
3. Currency: Is it within the acceptable freshness window?
4. Completeness: Are all required elements present?
5. Authenticity signals: Does it appear to be genuine?

Supports text/JSON evidence (via LLM text analysis) and image evidence
(screenshots, PDFs — via LLM vision capabilities).

You are an expert compliance auditor validating evidence artifacts for \

Your assessment must evaluate:

1. **Relevance** (0-100): Does this evidence directly relate to the control requirement?
   - 90-100: Directly demonstrates the control
   - 70-89: Strongly related but doesn't cover all aspects
   - 50-69: Partially relevant
   - Below 50: Tangentially or not relevant

2. **Sufficiency** (sufficient/partial/insufficient):
   - sufficient: An auditor would accept this as evidence of compliance
   - partial: Shows some implementation but missing key elements
   - insufficient: Does not demonstrate compliance

3. **Completeness**: What specific elements are present vs. missing?

4. **Authenticity**: Does this appear to be a genuine system export?

Be specific. Reference exact fields, values, and configuration settings \
in your assessment. Do not make vague statements.

## 10. REST API Design (FastAPI)

Base URL: `http://localhost:8743/api/v1`

The REST API is a thin wrapper around the Python library. Every endpoint delegates to library functions and returns Pydantic models serialized as JSON.

### 10.1 API Application Factory (evidentia/api/main.py)

## 15. Open-Source Ecosystem Integration Strategy

### What to Build On (Do Not Rebuild)

| Existing Tool/Library | How Evidentia Uses It | Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| **NIST OSCAL catalogs** (`usnistgov/oscal-content`) | Bundled as data files — the authoritative control catalog source for NIST frameworks | Data dependency (public domain) |
| **oscal-pydantic** (PyPI) | Pydantic models for OSCAL data types — used for OSCAL I/O, avoids rebuilding OSCAL schema | Library dependency |
| **LiteLLM** | Unified LLM interface — all AI calls route through this for provider agnosticism | Library dependency |
| **Instructor** | Structured output extraction — enforces Pydantic schema on LLM responses with auto-retry | Library dependency |
| **Steampipe** (optional) | Can invoke via subprocess for cloud infrastructure SQL queries as an alternative to direct SDK clients | Optional integration |
| **Cloud Custodian** (optional) | Can read Cloud Custodian policy check outputs as evidence artifacts | Optional evidence source |
| **Auditree** (IBM) | Architectural inspiration for the fetcher/check/locker evidence pattern; Evidentia's evidence locker is spiritually similar | Design inspiration |
| **CISO Assistant** | Evidentia accepts CISO Assistant JSON exports as inventory input; future: push gap data back via CISO Assistant API | Input/output integration |
| **`jira`** Python library | Direct dependency for Jira Cloud/Server integration | Library dependency |
| **`servicenow-api`** Python library | Direct dependency for ServiceNow integration | Library dependency |
| **boto3, azure-mgmt-\*, google-cloud-\*** | Direct dependencies for respective cloud evidence collectors | Library dependencies |
| **PyGithub** | Direct dependency for GitHub repository evidence collection | Library dependency |
| **okta-sdk-python** | Direct dependency for Okta identity evidence collection | Library dependency |

### What NOT to Rebuild

| Capability | Existing Tool | Why Not |
|---|---|---|
| Full GRC platform UI | CISO Assistant | Already well-built; Evidentia focuses on library/CLI/API, not UI |
| Framework content authoring | OSCAL CLI | NIST maintains this; no reason to duplicate |
| SIEM/SOAR workflows | Admyral, Tines | Different problem domain |
| Full risk management platform | SimpleRisk, Eramba | Evidentia generates risk statements, not manages the full risk lifecycle |
| Policy-as-code engine | OPA, Cloud Custodian | Evidentia consumes their outputs as evidence, doesn't replace them |
| Vulnerability scanning | Trivy, Grype, Nuclei | Evidentia maps scan results to controls, doesn't perform scanning |

### Evidentia's Unique Position

Evidentia is the **translation layer** between:

```
Raw Infrastructure Data          →  Evidentia  →  Audit-Ready Evidence
(AWS Config, GitHub, Okta)          (maps, validates,    (OSCAL, Jira tickets,
                                     generates risks)     gap reports, PDFs)
```

No existing open-source tool occupies this specific niche with a library-first, OSCAL-native approach.

---

## 16. Security & Credential Handling

### Credential Flow

All credentials are loaded from environment variables exclusively. The `evidentia.yaml` config file documents which environment variables are needed but never stores actual credential values.

```
┌─────────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐
│ Environment Variables│───→│ Pydantic Settings    │───→│ Connector Client │
│ (set by user or CI) │    │ (validates, types)    │    │ (boto3, PyGithub)│
└─────────────────────┘    └──────────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... ──→ config.llm.api_key ──→ LiteLLM
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=... ──→ boto3 (auto-discovers from environment)
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_... ──→ config.github.token ──→ PyGithub
```

### Required Environment Variables by Feature

| Feature | Required Variables | Optional Variables |
|---|---|---|
| **Gap Analysis** (core) | None | None |
| **Risk Generation** (AI) | One of: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | `EVIDENTIA_LLM_MODEL` |
| **AWS Collector** | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` + `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (or IAM role) | `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` |
| **Azure Collector** | `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` + `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` + `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` |
| **GCP Collector** | `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | — |
| **GitHub Collector** | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | — |
| **Okta Collector** | `OKTA_API_TOKEN` + `OKTA_DOMAIN` | — |
| **Jira Integration** | `JIRA_SERVER` + `JIRA_EMAIL` + `JIRA_API_TOKEN` | — |
| **ServiceNow Integration** | `SERVICENOW_INSTANCE` + `SERVICENOW_USERNAME` + `SERVICENOW_PASSWORD` | — |
| **REST API Auth** | — | `EVIDENTIA_API_KEY` |
| **Ollama (Local LLM)** | None (set model to `ollama/llama3.3`) | `EVIDENTIA_LLM_MODEL` |

### IAM Permissions Required per Collector

**AWS Config Collector** — Minimum IAM policy:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "config:DescribeComplianceByConfigRule",
        "config:GetComplianceDetailsByConfigRule",
        "config:DescribeConfigRules",
        "securityhub:GetFindings",
        "securityhub:BatchGetSecurityControls",
        "iam:GetAccountPasswordPolicy",
        "iam:GenerateCredentialReport",
        "iam:GetCredentialReport",
        "iam:ListMFADevices",
        "iam:ListUsers",
        "cloudtrail:DescribeTrails",
        "cloudtrail:GetTrailStatus",
        "sts:GetCallerIdentity"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**GitHub Collector** — Token scopes:
- `repo` (read access to private repos — required for branch protection rules)
- `read:org` (organization membership and settings)
- For public repos only: `public_repo` scope is sufficient

**Okta Collector** — API token with read-only scopes:
- `okta.policies.read`
- `okta.users.read`
- `okta.factors.read`
- `okta.groups.read`
- `okta.logs.read` (optional, for lifecycle events)

### Security Best Practices Enforced

1. **No credentials in config files:** `evidentia.yaml` contains zero secrets. All secrets flow through environment variables.
2. **No credential logging:** All logging sanitizes credential values. API keys are never printed, even at DEBUG level.
3. **Least privilege documentation:** README documents the minimum permissions needed for each collector.
4. **Content hashing:** All evidence artifacts include SHA-256 content hashes for tamper detection.
5. **Non-root Docker user:** Container runs as `evidentia` user, not root.
6. **Input validation:** All API inputs validated by Pydantic before processing. Extra fields rejected (`extra="forbid"`).
7. **Rate limiting awareness:** Collectors respect upstream API rate limits to avoid account lockout.
8. **HTTPS enforcement:** When API auth is enabled, documentation recommends running behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy.

## 17. Testing Strategy

### Test Pyramid

```
                ┌─────────┐
                │   E2E   │  ← Docker-based full stack tests (few, slow)
               ┌┤         ├┐
              ┌┤│         │├┐
             ┌┤││         │││

      └┴┴┴┴┴┴┴┴┴┴─────────┴┴┴┴┴┘
```

### Integration Tests (Mocked External Services)

| Test | Mock Library | What It Verifies |
|---|---|---|
| AWS collector | `moto` | Correct AWS API calls; Config rule → control mapping; multi-region |
| GitHub collector | `responses` | Branch protection parsing; CODEOWNERS detection; visibility checks |
| Okta collector | `responses` | MFA policy parsing; password policy extraction; inactive user detection |
| Jira integration | `responses` | Issue creation payload; idempotency; dry-run mode |
| ServiceNow integration | `responses` | Record creation payload; table selection; severity mapping |
| CLI gap analysis | `typer.testing.CliRunner` | End-to-end `evidentia gap analyze` with fixture data |
| CLI risk generation | `typer.testing.CliRunner` + VCR.py | End-to-end `evidentia risk generate` with recorded LLM response |
| API endpoints | `httpx` + `pytest-httpx` | All endpoints return correct status codes and response shapes |

### AI Tests (Special Considerations)

```python
# tests/unit/test_ai/test_risk_generator.py
"""Tests for risk statement generation.

Strategy:
1. Record LLM responses using pytest-recording (VCR.py) during development
2. Replay recorded responses in CI (no real API calls, no cost)
3. Validate that Instructor always produces valid RiskStatement
4. Test with multiple model configurations

### Performance Benchmarks

| Operation | Target | Measurement Method |
|---|---|---|
| Gap analysis (500 controls vs Moderate) | < 2 seconds | `pytest-benchmark` fixture |
| Risk statement generation (single, GPT-4o) | < 15 seconds | Wall clock, recorded response |
| AWS evidence collection (100 rules, 2 regions) | < 30 seconds | `moto`-mocked, async |
| Catalog loading (all 9 frameworks) | < 1 second | Cold start measurement |
| Crosswalk loading (all 6 crosswalks) | < 500ms | Cold start measurement |
| API response (GET /health) | < 50ms | `pytest-httpx` |
| API response (POST /gaps/analyze, small inventory) | < 3 seconds | `pytest-httpx` |

### Coverage Targets

| Package | Target | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `evidentia-core` | 90% | Core business logic — must be thoroughly tested |
| `evidentia-ai` | 70% | LLM calls are recorded/replayed; prompt logic tested via output validation |
| `evidentia-collectors` | 75% | Mocked external services; focus on parsing and mapping |
| `evidentia-integrations` | 80% | Mocked Jira/ServiceNow; verify payload construction |
| `evidentia` (CLI/API) | 70% | Integration-level tests cover most paths |

### Legal and Licensing Notes

- **NIST publications** (800-53, CSF, IR 8286): Public domain. No licensing restrictions. Freely distributable.
- **SOC 2 TSC**: The Trust Services Criteria are published by AICPA. Evidentia represents SOC 2 as an OSCAL profile mapping to NIST 800-53 controls rather than reproducing copyrighted TSC text verbatim. Control IDs (CC6.1, etc.) and titles are factual and not copyrightable.
- **ISO 27001:2022**: ISO standards are copyrighted. Evidentia represents ISO 27001 Annex A as an OSCAL profile pointing to NIST 800-53 controls. Control IDs (A.5.1, etc.) and short titles are factual references. Full control text is not reproduced.
- **CIS Controls v8**: Published under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives (CC BY-NC-ND). Evidentia references CIS control IDs and titles (factual) and maps them to NIST. Full safeguard text is not reproduced in the bundled data.
- **CMMC 2.0**: Based on NIST SP 800-171 (public domain). CMMC practice identifiers are public.
- **PCI DSS 4.0**: Published by PCI SSC. Evidentia references requirement IDs and short descriptions. Full requirement text is not reproduced.

### Crosswalk Authoritative Sources

| Crosswalk | Primary Source |
|---|---|
| NIST 800-53 ↔ SOC 2 TSC | AICPA "Mapping of AICPA Trust Services Criteria to NIST Cybersecurity Framework" + NIST SP 800-53 Appendix H |
| NIST 800-53 ↔ ISO 27001 | NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 Appendix H (Table H-4) |
| NIST 800-53 ↔ CIS Controls v8 | CIS Controls v8 Mapping to NIST 800-53 (published by CIS) |
| NIST 800-53 ↔ CMMC 2.0 | NIST SP 800-171 → NIST SP 800-53 mapping (Appendix D) + CMMC ↔ 800-171 |
| NIST 800-53 ↔ PCI DSS 4.0 | PCI SSC published mapping + NIST 800-53 Appendix H |
| NIST 800-53 ↔ CSF 2.0 | NIST CSF 2.0 Reference Tool mappings (published by NIST) |

## Appendix B: Known Risks & Mitigations

| # | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Framework crosswalk inaccuracy** — Mappings between frameworks may be incomplete or incorrect | Medium | High | Use only NIST-published and AICPA/CIS/PCI SSC-published crosswalks as primary sources. Document all sources. Include disclaimer that cross-framework mappings are advisory and require human review. Allow users to override mappings. |
| 2 | **LLM hallucination in risk statements** — AI generates fabricated control IDs, inaccurate technical details, or misleading risk ratings | Medium | Medium | Instructor enforces Pydantic schema validation. Low temperature (0.1). System prompt explicitly prohibits fabricated control IDs. Include mandatory human review step in workflow. Log model used and prompt for auditability. |
| 3 | **API credential exposure** — Credentials could be leaked through logs, error messages, or config files | Low | Critical | Credentials only from environment variables, never from config files. All logging sanitizes credential values. Docker runs as non-root user. Document least-privilege IAM policies. |
| 4 | **Integration breaking on upstream API changes** — Cloud provider, Jira, ServiceNow, or Okta APIs change | High | Medium | Pin integration library versions. Add integration health monitoring (`check_connection`). Version-aware connector design. Monitor upstream changelogs. Graceful degradation when one collector fails. |
| 5 | **Legal issues with framework content** — Reproducing copyrighted framework text | Low | High | Only use NIST-published OSCAL content (public domain). Represent commercial frameworks as OSCAL profiles pointing to NIST controls. Do not reproduce copyrighted text. Reference factual control IDs and titles only. |
| 6 | **Community not adopting** — Project fails to gain traction | Medium | High | Focus on GitHub SEO, clear README with demo GIF, working zero-config experience. Integrate with CISO Assistant (existing community). Blog series targeting GRC practitioners. Present at OSCAL workshops. |
| 7 | **OSCAL specification changes** — NIST updates OSCAL schema | Low | Medium | Depend on `oscal-pydantic` library (maintained by Credentive Security). Monitor OSCAL release notes. Abstract OSCAL I/O behind internal models. |
| 8 | **Performance degradation at scale** — Gap analysis or evidence collection slows with large inventories | Low | Medium | Profile critical paths. Use async I/O for collectors. Index catalogs in memory. Benchmark on every release. Target: <2s for 500-control gap analysis. |
| 9 | **LLM provider outage** — Primary LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic) is unavailable | Medium | Low | LiteLLM supports fallback models. Users can configure backup model. Core features (gap analysis) work without LLM. AI features degrade gracefully. |
| 10 | **Supply chain vulnerability** — Dependency with known CVE | Medium | Medium | Dependabot enabled. Regular `uv lock --upgrade`. Pin major versions. Minimal dependency surface. |

## Appendix E: OSCAL Output Mapping Specification

### Gap Report → OSCAL Assessment Results

Evidentia's gap reports map to OSCAL `assessment-results` as follows:

| Evidentia Concept | OSCAL Assessment Results Element |
|---|---|
| `GapAnalysisReport` | Root `assessment-results` object |
| `GapAnalysisReport.organization` | `metadata.title` |
| `GapAnalysisReport.analyzed_at` | `metadata.last-modified` |
| `GapAnalysisReport.frameworks_analyzed` | `import-ap` references |
| Each `ControlGap` | `result.finding` within `results` |
| `ControlGap.control_id` | `finding.target.target-id` |
| `ControlGap.gap_severity` | `finding.target.status` + custom property |
| `ControlGap.gap_description` | `finding.description` |
| `ControlGap.remediation_guidance` | `finding.response` (remediation) |
| Each `RiskStatement` | `result.risk` within `results` |

## Appendix F: Error Handling & Observability

### Structured Logging

All Evidentia components use Python's standard `logging` module with structured output. In JSON log mode (for production), every log entry includes:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-04-05T19:22:00.123Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "logger": "evidentia_core.gap_analyzer.analyzer",
  "message": "Gap analysis complete",
  "extra": {
    "organization": "Acme Corp",
    "frameworks": ["nist-800-53-mod", "soc2-tsc"],
    "total_gaps": 42,
    "coverage_pct": 87.3,
    "duration_ms": 1234
  }
}
```

### Error Classification

Errors are classified into three categories:

1. **User errors** (4xx in API, helpful messages in CLI): Invalid input, missing config, unsupported format. Always include actionable fix instructions.
2. **Integration errors** (5xx/warnings): Upstream service unreachable, authentication failure, rate limit. Include retry information and fallback options.
3. **Internal errors** (5xx): Bugs in Evidentia. Include stack trace in logs (not in user-facing output). Create GitHub issue template with reproduction steps.

### Health Monitoring

The `/health` endpoint (and `evidentia doctor` CLI) performs:

1. **Self-check:** Package versions, catalog loading, crosswalk integrity
2. **Collector health:** For each enabled collector, call `check_connection()` with a 10-second timeout
3. **Storage health:** Verify read/write access to storage backend
4. **LLM health:** If AI features configured, perform a minimal test call (optional, skipped by default to avoid cost)

Response includes degraded state reporting:
```json
{
  "status": "degraded",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "issues": [
    {"component": "aws-config", "severity": "warning", "message": "Access denied — missing config:DescribeComplianceByConfigRule permission"}
  ]
}
```

## Appendix G: Contributor Guide Architecture

### How to Add a New Collector

1. Create a new directory under `packages/evidentia-collectors/src/evidentia_collectors/`:
   ```
   my_service/
   ├── __init__.py
   └── collector.py
   ```

2. Implement the `BaseCollector` interface:
   ```python
   from evidentia_collectors.base import BaseCollector, ConnectionStatus
   
   class MyServiceCollector(BaseCollector):
       name = "my-service"
       display_name = "My Service"
       
       async def check_connection(self) -> ConnectionStatus: ...
       async def collect(self, ...) -> list[EvidenceArtifact]: ...
       def get_supported_controls(self) -> list[str]: ...
   ```

3. Register the collector in `evidentia_collectors/registry.py`

4. Add the collector to `evidentia.yaml` schema in `evidentia/config.py`

5. Write tests using `responses` or `moto` for mocking

6. Document required credentials and IAM permissions in the collector's docstring

### How to Add a New Framework

1. Create the catalog JSON file in `evidentia_core/catalogs/data/`:
   - Use OSCAL format if available from NIST
   - Use Evidentia JSON format if no OSCAL source exists

2. Create the crosswalk JSON file in `evidentia_core/catalogs/data/mappings/`:
   - Document the authoritative source for the mapping
   - Use NIST 800-53 as the source framework (all crosswalks go through NIST)

3. Add the framework to `FrameworkRegistry.list_frameworks()` metadata

4. Add the framework ID to the `FrameworkId` enum in `common.py`

5. Write unit tests verifying catalog loading and crosswalk integrity

6. Update the bundled framework data table in this document

### How to Add a New Output Integration

1. Create a new directory under `packages/evidentia-integrations/src/evidentia_integrations/`:
   ```
   my_output/
   ├── __init__.py
   ├── client.py
   └── formatters.py
   ```

2. Implement the client with:
   - Constructor taking credentials from environment variables
   - `create_gap_issues()` or equivalent method
   - Dry-run mode support
   - Idempotency (don't create duplicates)

3. Add CLI command in `evidentia/cli/push.py`

4. Add API endpoint in `evidentia/api/routers/gaps.py`

5. Document required credentials in the integration's docstring
