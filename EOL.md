# End-of-Life and Support Policy

Evidentia uses a **single-supported-patch** policy through v1.0,
transitioning to **latest patch of each supported minor** after v1.0.

## Pre-1.0 (v0.10.x line)

- The single latest patch is supported (no backports).
- Older patches in the same minor are deprecated the moment a successor ships.
- See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) Supported-versions table for current state.

## Post-1.0 (v1.x line; planned)

- Latest patch of each supported minor receives security updates.
- Two minor versions back receive security-only patches for **12 months**.
- Older minors are EOL.

## Cessation comms policy (OSPS-DO-05)

If Evidentia is sunset or transferred:

1. A `DEPRECATED.md` will land at the repo root with the announcement +
   transition path 90 days before any final patch.
2. The most recent supported patch will remain on PyPI indefinitely
   (PyPI does not delete published packages).
3. The latest container image will remain on `ghcr.io/polycentric-labs/evidentia`
   indefinitely (GitHub Container Registry retention).
4. Downstream FE consumers should review their dependency on Evidentia per
   DORA Art. 28 exit-strategy expectations.

## Versioning policy reference

Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 per [`README.md`](README.md). Pre-1.0:
minor bumps reserved for meaningful new feature surface; patches for
hardening, bug fixes, doc work, and supply-chain polish.
