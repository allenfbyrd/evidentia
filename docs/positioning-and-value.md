## 1. Executive summary

> **Section summary.** Evidentia (v0.7.8, May 2026) is the only
> open-source, Python-first, library-first, OSCAL-native GRC tool
> with bundled multi-framework catalogs (88), supply-chain-hardened
> evidence integrity (Sigstore + SLSA L3 + PEP 740 + cosign-signed
> container), and an air-gap-capable deployment model. It sits in a
> near-empty competitive niche, on the right side of **four**
> regulatory forcing functions converging in Q4 2026, and is
> intellectually descended from the Kellogg et al. ASE 2020
> "Continuous Compliance" thesis (now extended by the Khatchadourian
> March 2026 DFAH paper that names Evidentia's planned v0.8.0 flagship
> by its exact terminology). Its v0.7.x cycle has closed all 10
> BLOCKER items in the enterprise-grade credibility checklist and
> shipped 4 new public surfaces in v0.7.7-v0.7.8 (5 SQL DB collectors,
> Databricks, Snowflake, Tableau publish, Power BI publish).

- **Evidentia is the OSCAL-native, library-first, AI-optional, supply-chain-hardened, evidence-attesting GRC primitive that didn't exist in OSS until April 2026.** Eight unclaimed gaps in the OSS GRC ecosystem map directly onto Evidentia's surface (see §7).
- **The closest commercial peer with overlapping OSCAL claims is RegScale** ($30M Series B Sept 2025, donated OSCAL Hub to the foundation Dec 2025) — proprietary and Beltway-focused. **Optro (formerly AuditBoard, rebranded March 9, 2026)**, Vanta (now ships OSCAL **export** for FedRAMP 20x as of February 2026 — first major commercial vendor to do so), Drata, OneTrust, ServiceNow IRM, MetricStream all still have OSCAL gaps (see §5).
- **Four regulatory forcing functions converge in Q4 2026** (sharpened from "three" at v0.7.0 — the EU CRA reporting obligation date now firmly anchors): **CMMC Phase 2** (Level 2 C3PAO third-party assessments mandatory for ~300,000 DOD contractors, **2026-11-10**), **EU CRA reporting obligations** (24/72-hour incident + 14-day vulnerability reporting for any digital product placed on the EU market, **2026-09-11**), **FedRAMP OSCAL mandate** (machine-readable authorization data required for all CSPs, **2026-09-30**), **Maryland MODPA** (strictest US privacy law, sale-of-sensitive-data prohibition, **2026-10-01**). HIPAA Security Rule final-rule target window: May 2026. Evidentia is positioned 18+ months ahead of where most commercial vendors deliver native OSCAL emit (see §8).
- **The OSS GRC space remains structurally fragmented.** CISO Assistant (intuitem; 4,008 stars, AGPL+commercial; daily commits) is the most serious direct OSS competitor — but lacks OSCAL emit, Sigstore evidence chain, and SLSA L3 release artifacts. Comp AI raised **$20M Series A from Khosla's Keith Rabois in February 2026** (was $2.6M pre-seed Jan 2026 at v0.7.0 doc-write time) targeting the SaaS-startup SOC 2 self-serve market. Eramba effectively exited OSS — application code is closed-source as of recent years; only Docker helpers and templates remain on GitHub (see §5).
- **GRC remained the #1 sub-sector in cybersecurity M&A 2025** (82 deals, 5-year peak; SecurityWeek). **Vanta crossed $300M ARR April 2026** (3x in two years; +69% YoY logo growth; 16,000+ customers; $4.15B Series D valuation July 2025 — Sequoia, Wellington, Goldman Sachs Alternatives, JPM, Atlassian Ventures, CrowdStrike Ventures). **Drata ~$100M+ ARR early 2026; acquired SafeBase $250M February 2026** (Trust Center expansion). **Diligent acquired 3rdRisk January 14 2026** for AI-native TPRM. **OneTrust active PE talks November 2025** ($4.5B last priced; $550M+ ARR; Thoma Bravo / Blackstone / Silver Lake / KKR). **Wiz → Google $32B closed March 2026** (largest VC-backed exit in history). Customer flight risk from this consolidation creates a real opening for OSS that has no acquisition exposure (see §5, §8).
- **AI is now table-stakes parity in commercial GRC, not differentiation.** Every credible incumbent shipped (1) MCP server, (2) citation-grounded LLM output, and (3) agentic-with-checkpoint orchestration between Sept 2025 and April 2026 — Vanta AI Agent + remote MCP server (April 15, 2026); Drata Agentic TPRM + MCP server; Optro Unified AI Governance (built on FairNow acquisition); Workiva Intelligent Finance/GRC/Sustainability (March 2026); Hyperproof AI Guided Experiences (RSAC 2026); ServiceNow Now Assist for IRM. **The differentiation has collapsed into eval rigor + audit trails + OSS-friendly licensing** — exactly where Evidentia's Sigstore + PEP 740 + GenerationContext provenance + planned DFAH determinism harness sit (see §11).
- **The Delve scandal (March 2026) is the segment-defining 2026 incident** validating the AI-feature-commoditization thesis. MIT-dropout founders; $32M Series A July 2025 led by Insight Partners at $300M valuation. March 2026 whistleblower disclosure ("DeepDelver") — analysis of leaked audit reports found **493/494 SOC 2 reports with byte-identical boilerplate and identical grammatical errors**. Customers migrating away (one to Vanta + Insight Assurance after a Vercel breach). **This is the cautionary baseline Evidentia's positioning copy should cite for "deterministic-where-it-must-be, AI-where-it-helps"** (see §11, §14).
- **PCAOB AS 1105 + Generative AI Spotlight (July 2024) requires 5 capabilities; Evidentia hits all 5.** (1) Prompt + response capture — Evidentia v0.7.1 ✓; (2) Model-version tracking — v0.7.1 ✓; (3) Human-in-the-loop verification — DFAH addresses; (4) Immutable audit trails — DFAH addresses; (5) Explainability documentation — PRT addresses. **This is the strongest single positioning claim Evidentia can make** in the v0.8.0 cycle (see §11).
- **SR 11-7 superseded by SR 26-02 + OCC Bulletin 2026-13a (April 17, 2026)** — and the new guidance **explicitly excludes generative AI and agentic AI**: *"Generative AI and agentic AI models are novel and rapidly evolving. As such, they are not within the scope of this guidance."* Banks are stranded with no regulatory framework for LLM deployments. **This is the precise opening for Evidentia's planned v0.7.9 model-risk module** to ship the SR-11-7-replacement-framework primitive ahead of any commercial vendor (see §7, §11).
- **The positioning frame that wins**: *"Terraform / dbt of GRC"* — a library-first, CI-native primitive that orchestrates evidence and frameworks, rather than a SaaS dashboard. This sidesteps the Vanta/Drata bake-off Evidentia would lose, and competes inside the dev-tools-for-compliance trend Chainguard, Snyk, and Anchore validated (see §10).
- **Honest gaps** (intentionally surfaced, not buried): no customer-facing trust center, no questionnaire-fill AI, **6 evidence-collection surfaces** vs Vanta's 375+ integrations (Evidentia ships AWS, GitHub, Okta, ServiceNow, 5 SQL DB adapters, Databricks, Snowflake; Azure + GCP extras declared in pyproject.toml but currently lack implementations — see §5/§6 honest gap), no auditor partnerships, no Forrester Wave / Gartner inclusion, no TPRM module (planned v0.7.9), no risk register / ERM primitive, no published reference customers, no formal SOC 2 of Evidentia itself, no IPO/exit narrative for vendor-longevity-paranoid buyers. Each has a planned remediation or an explicit "won't fix" rationale (see §6).
- **Intellectual home**: an updated 30+ person community across NIST/GSA, OpenSSF, CISA-SBOM, Stanford CodeX, Bath/PRT, OSCAL Compass + OSCAL Foundation + Resilient Cyber / fwd:cloudsec / GRC-Engineering crowd. **NIST CSWP 53 *Charting the Course for NIST OSCAL*** (Iorga et al., December 2025 IPD) is now the canonical OSCAL strategic-direction citation, replacing older OSCAL references. Two outreach actions reach the entire community in one quarter (see §12).
- **The 12-month direction** that compounds Evidentia's advantages: ship a DFAH-style determinism harness for risk-statement generation (academic prior art exists — Khatchadourian arXiv 2601.15322 March 2026 — but **no commercial vendor offers this**); publish the bundled multi-framework crosswalk dataset as a standalone artifact (`evidentia-catalogs`); add canonical scanner-JSON-to-OSCAL mappers; ship an MCP server (note: first-mover window for OSCAL primitives is **closed** as of Q1 2026 — IBM trestle-MCP, AWS Labs OSCAL MCP, Vanta MCP, Drata MCP, Optro MCP all live; **wide open** for SR-11-7 / FFIEC / SBOM / continuous-monitoring MCPs); ship the v0.7.9 federal-compliance overlay (TPRM + model risk + 7 new catalogs + governance primitives); pursue OSCAL Foundation membership; cut v0.8.x around AI evidence validation + multimodal evidence support; publish the **first standardized GRC LLM eval suite to Hugging Face** (HF Hub keyword searches confirm zero existing OSCAL/NIST 800-53/SOC 2 datasets — genuine first-in-class opportunity; see §13).

## 2. What Evidentia is, and why it exists

> **Section summary.** Evidentia is a composable Python GRC toolkit
> (six packages + a React SPA) that turns compliance from a
> spreadsheet problem into a software problem. It exists because
> commercial GRC SaaS has consolidated around closed, OSCAL-blind,
> AI-mandatory, $30k+/yr platforms that exclude both regulated
> sovereign deployments (FedRAMP, EU DORA, air-gap) and the
> ~300,000 DOD contractors who can't afford SaaS GRC.

### 2.1 What it is

Evidentia is an **open-source (Apache 2.0), Python 3.12+, OSCAL-native Governance, Risk, and Compliance toolkit**. It ships as six composable PyPI packages plus a Vite + React + shadcn/ui web frontend, all in one [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) workspace monorepo:

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `evidentia-core` | Pydantic data models, OSCAL catalog loader, crosswalk engine, gap analyzer |
| `evidentia-ai` | LiteLLM + Instructor client, risk-statement generator, control explainer |
| `evidentia-collectors` | Evidence collection — AWS Config + Security Hub + IAM Access Analyzer; GitHub branch protection + CODEOWNERS + Dependabot |
| `evidentia-integrations` | Jira push + bidirectional status sync; ServiceNow / Vanta / Drata queued |
| `evidentia-api` | FastAPI server bundling the React SPA for `evidentia serve` |
| `evidentia` | CLI meta-package: Typer/Rich entry points (`evidentia` + `cb` alias) |
| `evidentia-ui` *(non-Python)* | Vite + React 18 + shadcn/ui frontend; built bundle is copied into `evidentia-api` at wheel time |

It can be used three ways: as a Python library (`from evidentia_core import GapAnalyzer`), as a CLI (`evidentia gap analyze --inventory ...`), or as a REST API + web UI (`evidentia serve` → localhost-only dashboard with 18 `/api/*` endpoints).

### 2.2 Why it exists

The thesis is structural: **GRC is stuck in 2005**. The typical compliance program runs on:

- **Spreadsheets** copy-pasted between auditors, engineers, and exec staff
- **Vendor GRC suites** that cost $50K–$500K/year, lock you in, and still require weeks of manual cross-framework mapping
- **Point solutions** that handle one piece (a vulnerability scanner, a policy tracker, a questionnaire manager) but can't talk to each other
- **Consultants** who re-learn your environment from scratch every audit cycle

Meanwhile, the compliance workload keeps growing. A single fintech or healthcare SaaS company today might simultaneously be in scope for **SOC 2, PCI DSS 4.0, HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA, ISO 27001, EU DORA, EU AI Act, NYDFS Part 500** — nine frameworks with substantial overlap, each demanding its own evidence, gap analysis, and risk documentation. The same control (say, "MFA on all privileged accounts") satisfies requirements in all nine, but because each framework uses different vocabulary, numbering, and organization, compliance teams end up documenting the same control nine different ways.

**This is a software problem.** Evidentia treats it as one — composable libraries, structured data (OSCAL), version control, automation, signed evidence with cryptographic provenance.

### 2.3 The four design principles

1. **Open standards, not vendor lock-in.** Inputs and outputs use [OSCAL](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/) — NIST's open standard for control catalogs and assessment results. If you outgrow Evidentia, your data travels with you.
2. **Library-first, CLI-second, API-third.** The Python library is the canonical interface. The CLI and REST API are thin wrappers. Everything Evidentia can do via the CLI, it can do from a Python script — which means you can embed it in CI pipelines, compliance portals, or custom integrations.
3. **AI where it helps, not where it hurts.** Evidentia uses LLMs for tasks where language understanding is the bottleneck (writing NIST SP 800-30 risk statements, explaining a control in plain English). It uses deterministic code for tasks where correctness matters (OSCAL parsing, gap arithmetic, cross-framework mapping). AI is opt-in; air-gap deployments work without LLM access.
4. **Provider-agnostic LLM access.** All AI features route through [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/) + [Instructor](https://python.useinstructor.com/), giving structured Pydantic output from any model — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure, Bedrock, Ollama, vLLM. No vendor lock-in on the AI layer either.

### 2.4 Who it's for

- **Security engineers** at startups and mid-size companies who need to hit SOC 2 Type II without hiring a full compliance team
- **GRC consultants** who want to stop rebuilding the same spreadsheets for every engagement
- **Platform teams** who want to embed gap analysis into their CI pipelines and catch drift before the auditor does
- **CISO offices** that want a real audit trail on risk decisions, backed by versioned structured data instead of Slack threads
- **Defense contractors** facing CMMC Phase 2 (Nov 2026) who can't afford $30k/yr SaaS for SPRS-affirmation evidence
- **EU regulated entities** under DORA (in force since Q1 2026) who need sovereign / on-prem evidence collection
- **Federal agencies** facing OMB M-24-15 (July 2026) requiring OSCAL ingestion and emission

## 3. Current capabilities (v0.7.8)

> **Section summary.** As of v0.7.8 (May 2026, code-complete locally;
> 10-commit chain awaiting tag), Evidentia ships 9 Typer CLI command
> groups, 12 REST router modules, an 8-page React SPA (alpha.2
> wired-in at v0.7.6), six Python packages with public APIs +
> evidentia-ui frontend that bundles into the API server, **8 evidence
> collection surfaces** (AWS, GitHub, Okta, ServiceNow, 5 SQL DB
> adapters [Postgres / MySQL / SQLite / MSSQL / Oracle], Databricks,
> Snowflake), **4 output integrations** (Jira, ServiceNow, Tableau
> publish, Power BI publish — last two NEW in v0.7.8), AI-powered
> risk-statement + control-explanation generation with full
> GenerationContext provenance (model + temperature + prompt-hash +
> run-id), **89 bundled framework catalogs** (4 redistribution tiers),
> bundled crosswalks, four output formats including OSCAL Assessment
> Results with embedded SHA-256 evidence digests + Sigstore/Rekor or
> GPG signing, cosign-signed container image at
> `ghcr.io/allenfbyrd/evidentia` with SLSA L3 build provenance

> credibility checklist remain closed; v0.7.5 added cosign container
> publish (closing L1); v0.7.7 added 5 SQL collectors + Okta +
> ServiceNow; v0.7.8 adds the cloud-DW + BI surfaces. Inventory below
> is from a direct codebase walk on 2026-05-02 (Stream 7 of the v0.7.8
> Step 2 research had documented hallucinations and was not used).

Localhost-only, WCAG 2.1 AA via Radix primitives. Multi-user auth / RBAC is queued for v0.7.x+.

### 3.4 Evidence collectors (with explicit blind-spot disclosures)

Each collector follows the v0.7.0 enterprise-grade pattern: typed
exception hierarchy, `CollectionContext` threaded through every
finding, `CollectionManifest` returned by `collect_v2()` for
completeness attestation, ECS-structured audit logging, lazy SDK
import so the package loads without the optional driver, explicit
`BLIND_SPOTS` list per adapter.

- **AWS** (v0.5.0+; `[aws]` extra) — Config compliance rules + Security Hub findings + IAM Access Analyzer (5 explicit blind-spot disclosures: KMS grants, S3 ACL/BPA interactions, service-linked roles, unsupported resource types, finding-generation latency). Standard boto3 credential chain.
- **GitHub** (v0.5.0+; `[github]` extra) — Branch protection + CODEOWNERS + repo visibility + Dependabot alerts (100-page safety cap on pagination). `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var.
- **Okta** (v0.7.7; `[okta]` extra) — User inventory + MFA enforcement + inactive-user detection + privileged-account counts. Mapped to NIST AC-2, IA-2, IA-5. `okta>=2.9` driver.
- **ServiceNow** (v0.7.7; `[servicenow]` in evidentia-integrations) — bidirectional integration (also output side); compliance task / incident records. `pysnc>=1.1` driver.
- **5 SQL DB adapters** (v0.7.7; `[sql-postgres]`, `[sql-mysql]`, `[sql-sqlite]`, `[sql-mssql]`, `[sql-oracle]`) — DB-resident compliance evidence (user privileges, audit-log status, encryption posture, schema change history) mapped to NIST AC-2 / AC-3 / AC-6 / AU-2 / AU-3 / SC-12 / SC-28. SQLite uses stdlib (no extra). MSSQL requires OS-level Microsoft ODBC Driver 18. Oracle uses `oracledb>=2.0` thin driver (pure Python).
- **Databricks** (v0.7.8; `[databricks]` extra) — PAT inventory + lifecycle (long-lived, never-expires findings); cluster compliance (runtime version + libraries + init scripts) → CM-2 / CM-3 / CM-8 / SI-2; service principal inventory + active/inactive → AC-2 / AC-2(3) / AC-3; secret scope inventory (Databricks-backed vs Azure Key Vault-backed) → SC-12 / IA-5. Auth via `databricks-sdk>=0.30` unified resolver (PAT, OAuth M2M, Azure AD, AWS IAM, `.databrickscfg`). 7 documented BLIND_SPOTS. **DEFERRED to v0.7.9+**: Unity Catalog audit logs + table/column lineage (need SQL Warehouse plumbing); workspace network policies (need Account API auth path).
- **Snowflake** (v0.7.8; `[snowflake]` extra) — LOGIN_HISTORY (per-user inventory + per-failed-login row over 90-day window) → AC-7 / AU-2 / AU-3 / IR-4; USERS inventory + MFA enforcement + disabled-account + never-logged-in findings → AC-2 / AC-2(3) / IA-2(1)/(2); GRANTS_TO_USERS inventory + privileged-role grants (ACCOUNTADMIN / SECURITYADMIN / ORGADMIN) → AC-3 / AC-6 / AC-6(7); network-policy inventory + account-level baseline → SC-7 / SC-7(5); masking + row-access policy inventory per database → AC-3 / AC-3(7) / SC-28; operator-attested key-rotation status → SC-12. Auth via `snowflake-connector-python>=3.10` (password env var or key-pair preferred for production — Snowflake is deprecating password auth). 7 documented BLIND_SPOTS. **DEFERRED to v0.7.9+**: ACCESS_HISTORY lineage; failed-login spike detection.

**Honest note**: `[azure]` and `[gcp]` extras were declared in
`packages/evidentia-collectors/pyproject.toml` from v0.5.0 through
v0.7.7 without backing implementations. The v0.7.8 pre-release-review
(Step 5.A batch fix) removed the unbacked extras + their entries from
the umbrella `[all]` extra + the package `keywords` list. Azure + GCP
remain on the forward roadmap (architectural sketches in
`Evidentia-Architecture-and-Implementation-Plan.md`); when those
collectors ship, the extras will be re-introduced alongside the
implementing modules.

### 3.5 Output integrations (Jira / ServiceNow / Tableau / Power BI)

- **Jira** (v0.5.0+; `[jira]` extra) — push gaps as issues + bidirectional status sync. `jira>=3.8` driver.
- **ServiceNow** (v0.7.7; `[servicenow]` extra) — push gaps as records (incident / sn_grc_issue / custom). `pysnc>=1.1` driver.
- **Tableau publish** (v0.7.8; `[tableau]` extra) — publishes 3 datasets to Tableau Server / Cloud as CSV-based data sources: `evidentia-gaps` (one row per ControlGap), `evidentia-risks` (NIST SP 800-30 shape with AI-provenance fields), `evidentia-collection-runs` (CollectionContext audit trail). PAT auth via `TABLEAU_PAT_NAME` + `TABLEAU_PAT_SECRET` env vars (never accepted as flag values). `tableauserverclient>=0.30` (pure Python). **`.hyper` extract publish documented as v0.7.9+ enhancement** under separate `[tableau-hyper]` extra (would require heavyweight `tableauhyperapi` native binary).
- **Power BI publish** (v0.7.8; `[powerbi]` extra) — pushes same 3 datasets as Power BI Push Datasets via REST API + Azure AD service-principal OAuth2 (MSAL Python). Full-refresh semantics by default (clear-then-push). 10,000-row batching per Power BI's documented limit. Schema-declared dataset auto-creation via `ensure_dataset` (idempotent re-runs). Auth: service principal with `Dataset.ReadWrite.All`; client secret from `POWERBI_CLIENT_SECRET` env var server-side; never in request bodies. `msal>=1.31` driver.

### 3.6 Bundled framework catalogs (89 total, four redistribution tiers)

**89 catalog files (.json)** verified by direct codebase walk
post-v0.7.9 (was 82 at v0.7.0; +7 in v0.7.9 — 5 FFIEC IT
Examination Handbook booklets + OCC 2011-12/FRB SR 11-7 + FFIEC
Cybersecurity Assessment Tool). The tier breakdown below is
the v0.7.0 baseline; per-catalog accounting is in
`packages/evidentia-core/src/evidentia_core/catalogs/`. **+7 catalog
additions shipped in v0.7.9** (5 FFIEC IT Examination Handbook
booklets + OCC 2011-12 / FRB SR 11-7 + FFIEC Cybersecurity Assessment
Tool — but note the FFIEC CAT was sunset by FFIEC 2025-08-31 in favor
of NIST CSF 2.0 + CRI Profile v2.0; v0.7.9 plan needs touch-up to
either ship CAT as historical reference or substitute CRI Profile).

- **Tier A — US federal (25 frameworks, verbatim public domain)**: NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 full catalog (1,196 controls) + Low/Moderate/High/Privacy baselines, 800-171 r2/r3, 800-172, CSF 2.0, AI RMF 1.0, Privacy Framework 1.0, SSDF 800-218; FedRAMP Rev 5 baselines; CMMC 2.0 L1/L2/L3; HIPAA Security/Privacy/Breach Notification; GLBA Safeguards, NY DFS 500, NERC CIP v7, FDA 21 CFR Pt 11, IRS 1075, CMS ARS, FBI CJIS v6, CISA CPGs.

### 3.7 Enterprise-grade hardening (v0.7.0 BLOCKER baseline + v0.7.x additions)

The v0.7.0 release closed all 10 BLOCKER items in the [enterprise-grade credibility checklist](enterprise-grade.md). The supply-chain hardening narrative is end-to-end and has tightened across v0.7.x:

- **Evidence integrity**: SHA-256 digest + Sigstore/Rekor signing (online) or GPG signing (air-gap) on every Assessment Results document
- **Build provenance** (v0.7.0; tightened v0.7.3): GitHub Actions workflow with OIDC identity; SLSA L3 build provenance via `actions/attest-build-provenance@v2.4.0` (v0.7.3) — restores `gh attestation verify` as a working verifier alongside `pypi-attestations verify pypi`
- **Signed publish**: PyPI Trusted Publisher (OIDC) on all 6 packages — no long-lived API tokens
- **Per-artifact attestations**: PEP 740 Sigstore attestations on every wheel + sdist, logged to Rekor
- **Container image** (v0.7.5; `ghcr.io/allenfbyrd/evidentia`): cosign keyless OIDC signing + SLSA L3 build provenance against image digest. Closes enterprise-grade L1 (was the last LOW-bucket external-artifact gap). v0.7.6+ added `Wait-for-PyPI` step to prevent propagation-race re-fires.
- **Software bill of materials**: CycloneDX 1.6 SBOM attached to every GitHub Release
- **Schema conformance**: `compliance-trestle>=4.0` round-trip in CI catches unknown-field bugs NIST's JSON Schema misses
- **Structured logs**: ECS 8.11 + NIST AU-3 + OpenTelemetry via `--json-logs` flag
- **Air-gap mode**: `--offline` flag refuses network egress; Sigstore refuses and routes operators to GPG; `evidentia doctor --check-air-gap` validator
- **Composite GitHub Action** (v0.7.3; SHA-pinned): `.github/actions/gap-analysis/` replaces the archived standalone repo; 28 SHA-pinned `uses:` refs across composite + every workflow file (closes Scorecard "Pinned-Dependencies"). Composite-action E2E smoke test workflow catches future action.yml ↔ CLI drift
- **Pre-commit hooks + dev container** (v0.7.3): ruff + mypy + markdownlint + trailing-whitespace; `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` for reproducible dev env
- **OpenSSF Scorecard** (v0.7.2): weekly workflow publishing to securityscorecards.dev
- **Threat model** (v0.7.7 elevation): `docs/threat-model.md` (12KB); refreshed within 180 days per pre-release-review v4 G5 gate
- **OpenSSF Best Practices Badge**: pre-application audit complete (v0.7.5 P0.7); badge filing pending (v0.7.5 deferral)
- **Critical security batch** (v0.7.5 P0.5; v0.7.7 + v0.7.8 carry-forward): 14 HIGH py/path-injection alerts auto-closed; 1 HIGH py/polynomial-redos closed; 3 MEDIUM stack-trace exposure fixed; 4 MEDIUM workflow-permissions tightened; 5 MEDIUM Pinned-Dependencies; v0.7.8 added P0.5 fix-up batch (SQLite collector mandatory `safe_root` validation; user-controlled values switched to `%r` in log statements)

> Ernst, ASE 2020). The single most important paper Evidentia
> extends is Kellogg et al. — Evidentia is the natural follow-up
> work at OSCAL/multi-framework scale.

### 4.1 OSCAL standardization (NIST)

OSCAL has **no canonical academic paper** — it is documented through NIST Special Publications, the [OSCAL spec](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/), the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL), and workshop talks. **The new canonical citation as of December 2025 is [NIST CSWP 53 *Charting the Course for NIST OSCAL*](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/cswp/53/charting-the-course-for-nist-oscal/ipd)** (Iorga et al., Initial Public Draft, December 2025) — this is the strategic-direction document Evidentia should anchor "OSCAL-native" claims to. CSWP 53 commits OSCAL to "modernize manual, paper-based cybersecurity compliance through automated, scalable processes and continuous assessments."

Principal architects: **Dr. Michaela Iorga** (NIST ITL Senior Security Technical Lead, OSCAL Strategic Outreach Director, [NIST staff page](https://www.nist.gov/people/dr-michaela-iorga)), **David Waltermire** (OSCAL Technical Director), **Brian Ruf** (RufRisk; OSCAL Foundation FedRAMP Tech Focus Group Lead). **Eduardo "Ed" Takamura** (NIST RMF Team, FISMA implementation lead, [NIST staff page](https://www.nist.gov/people/ed-takamura)) drives the broader RMF evolution that Evidentia's gap analyzer maps into.

The conceptual hierarchy — Catalog → Profile → Component Definition → SSP → Assessment Plan → Assessment Results → POA&M — is itself a model-driven engineering construct that has never been formalized in peer review. **This is a publishable opportunity for Evidentia** (a workshop paper at SecDev or an arXiv preprint formalizing OSCAL's profile-resolution semantics would land in genuinely empty territory).

### 4.2 Software supply-chain attestation

Evidentia's Sigstore + PEP 740 + CycloneDX SBOM stack inherits directly from:

- **Ralph Merkle** — "Secrecy, Authentication, and Public Key Systems" (Stanford PhD thesis, 1979) — mathematical basis for every modern transparency log
- **Stuart Haber & W. Scott Stornetta** — "How to Time-Stamp a Digital Document" (J. Cryptology, 1991) — foundation of RFC 3161
- **Scott A. Crosby & Dan S. Wallach** — "Efficient Data Structures for Tamper-Evident Logging" (USENIX Security 2009) — canonical citation for tamper-evident audit logs
- **Justin Cappos & Santiago Torres-Arias et al.** — in-toto (USENIX Security 2019) — supply-chain attestation framework
- **Newman, Meyers, Torres-Arias et al.** — Sigstore (CCS 2022) — software signing for everybody
- **Ben Laurie et al.** — Certificate Transparency (RFC 6962, CACM 2014) — theoretical underpinning of Rekor

### 4.3 Policy-as-code formal verification

The lineage from Belnap's four-valued logic (1977) through Bonatti's policy algebra (ACM TISSEC 2002) to Cedar's Lean-verified symbolic compiler (OOPSLA 2024, https://www.amazon.science/publications/cedar-a-new-language-for-expressive-fast-safe-and-analyzable-authorization) is the conceptual vocabulary Evidentia uses for control-implementation reasoning. Cedar is uniquely important: its symbolic compiler is verified in Lean (https://lean-lang.org/use-cases/cedar/) — soundness AND completeness proven mechanically.

### 4.4 Continuous compliance (the most important single citation)

**Kellogg, Schäf, Tasiran, Ernst — "Continuous Compliance"** (ASE 2020, [DOI 10.1145/3324884.3416593](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/pubs/continuous-compliance-ase2020-abstract.html)) is the foundational paper Evidentia extends. They argue that traditional compliance audits (SOC, PCI DSS) are point-in-time, and that continuous compliance via lightweight type-system-style verification on each commit can keep a codebase certifiable. They demonstrate it for PCI DSS using checker-framework-style analyses. Replication artifacts at https://zenodo.org/records/3976221.

**Evidentia operationalizes this thesis at OSCAL/multi-framework scale**, with Sigstore-backed evidence integrity, structured-output AI for risk statements, and as of v0.7.8 cloud-DW + BI-publish surfaces. That is the cleanest one-line intellectual narrative.

### 4.5 AI-on-compliance bleeding-edge (NEW for v0.7.8 refresh)

Three arXiv papers verified to exist (May 2026) that name Evidentia's planned v0.8.0 features by their exact terminology — this is the strongest academic-substrate claim Evidentia can make:

- **Khatchadourian, *Replayable Financial Agents: A Determinism-Faithfulness Assurance Harness for Tool-Using LLM Agents*** ([arXiv 2601.15322](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15322), Jan 2026, v2 March 2026). 4,700 runs across 7 models. Establishes trajectory-determinism + decision-determinism + evidence-conditioned faithfulness for regulatory audit replay. Found *r = -0.11* between determinism and accuracy; schema-focused designs meet audit replay requirements. **DFAH = Determinism-Faithfulness Assurance Harness** (NOT "Decision-Faithfulness Assessment" as some Evidentia internal docs incorrectly expanded — corrected during the v0.7.8 review). This paper is the canonical citation for Evidentia's planned v0.8.0 P0.1 `evidentia eval` CLI.

- **Imperial & Tayyar Madabushi, *Scaling Policy Compliance Assessment in Language Models with Policy Reasoning Traces*** ([arXiv 2509.23291](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23291), Sept 2025; University of Bath). Establishes SOTA on HIPAA + GDPR compliance assessment via Policy Reasoning Traces (PRT) — explicit chain-of-thought citing exact policy clauses per claim. Canonical citation for Evidentia's planned v0.8.0 P0.2 `evidentia risk generate --emit-trace` mode.

- **Ma et al., *Unifying Multimodal Retrieval via Document Screenshot Embedding*** ([arXiv 2406.11251](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11251), June 2024; University of Waterloo). DSE encodes screenshots of documents (not parsed structure) via a vision-language model, outperforming BM25 by 17 points on Wiki-SS. **DSE = Document Screenshot Embedding** (NOT "Document Structure Embeddings"). Applicable to Evidentia's planned v0.8.0 P2.1 evidence-validation preview.

**Adjacent surveys to anchor a v0.8.0 P2.3 GRC eval suite contribution**: Gu et al. 2024 *A Survey on LLM-as-a-Judge* ([arXiv 2411.15594](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15594)); Tian et al. 2025 *Overconfidence in LLM-as-a-Judge* ([HF Papers 2508.06225](https://hf.co/papers/2508.06225)); Liu et al. 2025 *MetaFaith: Faithful Natural Language Uncertainty Expression in LLMs* ([HF Papers 2505.24858](https://hf.co/papers/2505.24858)). Plus Geng et al. 2025 *JSONSchemaBench* ([HF Papers 2501.10868](https://hf.co/papers/2501.10868)) — directly applicable to OSCAL-conformant generation eval.

**RAG-for-legal/regulatory-text** substrate: Guha et al. 2023 *LegalBench* ([arXiv 2308.11462](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11462)) — Stanford CodeX, 40-author collaboration; Pipitone & Houir Alami 2024 *LegalBench-RAG* ([HF Papers 2408.10343](https://hf.co/papers/2408.10343)); Ho et al. 2025 *Incorporating Legal Structure in Retrieval-Augmented Generation* ([HF Papers 2505.02164](https://hf.co/papers/2505.02164)).

**Fine-tuned compliance LLM prior art**: Zhu et al. 2024 *LegiLM: A Fine-Tuned Legal Language Model for Data Compliance* ([HF Papers 2409.13721](https://hf.co/papers/2409.13721)) — GDPR-specific fine-tune; Tamo et al. 2026 *EvidenceRL* ([HF Papers 2603.19532](https://hf.co/papers/2603.19532)) — GRPO-based RL for evidence grounding in legal reasoning, F1 from 32.8% to 67.6%; highly relevant to Evidentia's evidence-attestation pipeline.

### 4.6 Regulatory updates affecting Evidentia's intellectual home (NEW for v0.7.8)

- **SR 11-7 has been superseded** (April 17, 2026) by **SR 26-02** + **OCC Bulletin 2026-13a** ([Federal Reserve SR 26-02 PDF](https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2602.pdf), [OCC 2026-13a](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2026/bulletin-2026-13a.pdf)). Critically, the new guidance **explicitly excludes generative AI and agentic AI**: *"Generative AI and agentic AI models are novel and rapidly evolving. As such, they are not within the scope of this guidance."* Banks are stranded with no regulatory framework for LLM deployments; agencies promised a future RFI. Evidentia's v0.7.9 plan (currently references SR 11-7) needs touch-up to reference both the original (historical lineage) and the 2026 revisions (current applicability) — and the v0.7.9 model-risk module becomes the precise opening for SR-11-7-replacement-framework primitives.

- **PCAOB AS 1105 amendments** + the July 2024 *Generative AI Spotlight* ([PCAOB.org](https://pcaobus.org/documents/generative-ai-spotlight.pdf), [AS 1105 details](https://pcaobus.org/oversight/standards/auditing-standards/details/AS1105)) are now the regulator-recognized framework for AI in audit reports. Five required capabilities: prompt + response capture, model-version tracking, human-in-the-loop verification, immutable audit trails, explainability documentation. **Evidentia's v0.7.1 audit trails capture (1) + (2); planned v0.8.0 DFAH addresses (3) + (4); planned v0.8.0 PRT addresses (5).** This is a remarkable alignment and the strongest single positioning claim Evidentia can make in the v0.8.0 cycle.

- **NIST AI RMF crosswalk status**: [NIST AI RMF crosswalks page](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework/crosswalks-nist-artificial-intelligence-risk-management-framework) — NIST has *not* published a formal AI RMF ↔ SR 11-7 crosswalk, deliberately keeping the two domains separate. The Generative AI Profile [NIST.AI.600-1](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.600-1.pdf) covers Govern / Map / Measure / Manage for generative AI. Evidentia's v0.7.9 catalog work should crosswalk forward from AI RMF + NIST 800-53 + OSCAL into SR 11-7 manually until NIST publishes an authoritative crosswalk.

The OSS GRC tier kept surging through 2025-26. **None of these is a permissively-licensed, library-first, OSCAL-native, multi-framework Python toolkit with cryptographically-signed evidence chain-of-custody.** That gap is Evidentia's slot.

| Project | Stars / Activity (May 2026) | Shape | License | Evidentia adjacency |

| **Openlane** (`theopenlane.io`) | Apache-2.0 | OSS GRC platform | Apache-2.0 | Different shape (platform vs library) |
| **VerifyWise** | BSL 1.1 | AI-governance-focus OSS, 24+ frameworks incl. EU AI Act + ISO 42001 | BSL 1.1 | Different shape; AI-governance vertical |
| **OWASP/OpenCRE** | 154 stars; latest 2026-05-02 | Maps CRE → ASVS, NIST, ISO; quiet but genuine asset | CC0-1.0 | **Could feed Evidentia's catalog cross-walks**; complementary |
| **MITRE/saf** | 177 stars; latest 2026-05-02 | Security Automation Framework CLI; transforms heterogeneous scan output → OHDF/HDF; OSCAL-aware | Apache-2.0 | **Closest in spirit to Evidentia of the MITRE projects**; absorption-candidate pattern (extend evidence-ingestion) |
| **MITRE/caldera** | 6,932 stars; latest 2026-05-01 | DoD-funded; threat-side adversary emulation | Apache-2.0 | Produces evidence-of-control-effectiveness Evidentia could consume |
| **inspec/inspec** | 3,064 stars; Progress Software stewards | Config-compliance scanner; evidence at host level | Apache-2.0 | Adjacent (config-scan); could be ingested as evidence |

| **RS-Credentive/oscal-pydantic** | 23 / 5; last push 2024-04-06 (2+ years stale) | Pydantic models autogenerated from OSCAL schemas | Apache-2.0 | Functionally archived; Evidentia could supersede |
| **Eramba** ([eramba/docker](https://github.com/eramba/docker)) | 70 stars (docker repo); latest 2026-04-22 | **Application is no longer open source**; only Docker helpers + scenario templates ship publicly; Community Edition is freemium binary | Closed-source application + open Docker helpers | **Effectively exited OSS** in recent years; remains a competitor by mindshare but no longer by code |

### 5.6 AI-native challengers (last 18 months — NEW for v0.7.8)

A genuinely new tier surfaced through v0.7.x. Capital concentrated in agentic-AI-native compliance automation:

- **Complyance** [complyance.com](https://www.complyance.com): **$20M Series A Feb 2026** led by Google Ventures (Anthropic + Mastercard senior-leadership angels); existing Creandum/HV/Speedinvest. **Sixteen production AI agents; expanding to thirty.** Threat to Evidentia: nominally similar AI-agent surface; differentiation is OSCAL + Sigstore + license posture.
- **Oneleet** [oneleet.com](https://www.oneleet.com): **$33M Series A** led by Dawn Capital. Bundled platform: vCISO services + asset monitoring + pen-testing + SOC 2/ISO 27001/HIPAA/PCI/GDPR/DORA. Premium-priced **anti-"compliance-theater" positioning**.
- **Haast** ([Angel Investors Network](https://angelinvestorsnetwork.com/regulatory-compliance/ai-compliance-automation-raises-12m-series-a-in-2026)): **$12M Series A April 9 2026** (Peak XV Partners); 4.5x YoY revenue, zero churn. Vertical specialization in marketing/legal-review compliance for FS, pharma, FMCG. Customers: Telstra, Zurich AU/NZ, Aviva, Future Super.
- **Sphere** ([TechCrunch Nov 2025](https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/a16z-leads-21m-series-a-into-tax-compliance-platform-sphere/)): **$21M Series A November 2025** led by a16z for tax compliance automation.
- **Relyance AI** ([TechCrunch Oct 2024](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/10/relyance-helps-companies-comply-with-data-regulations/)): $32M Series B October 2024 (Thomvest, M12, Menlo, Unusual), $59M total. **Data-lineage-driven privacy/vendor-risk.**
- **OSCAL infrastructure layer**: RegScale launched **OSCAL Hub** ([RegScale blog](https://regscale.com/blog/introducing-oscal-hub/)); **ARPaCCino academic prototype** demonstrates agentic-RAG-to-Rego policy generation for IaC ([arXiv 2507.10584](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.10584v1)); NIST ran an **OSCAL-Augmented CISO Agent workshop in 2025** ([NIST CSRC](https://csrc.nist.gov/presentations/2025/oscal-based-ai-augmented-ciso-agent)).

### 5.7 Foundational layer Evidentia integrates

- **NIST OSCAL** (877 stars) + **oscal-content** (430 stars) — canonical schema + 800-53 catalogs
- **ComplianceAsCode/content** (2,710 stars) — SCAP/STIG content for RHEL/Ubuntu hardening
- **CycloneDX/cyclonedx-python** (371 stars) — SBOM generator (Evidentia uses for `evidentia-sbom.cdx.json`)
- **Sigstore/cosign** (5,844 stars) — signing + Rekor transparency log (Evidentia uses for evidence + release attestations)
- **in-toto/in-toto** (999 stars) — supply-chain attestation framework (related)

### 6.1 The seven genuine differentiators (vs. all four commercial tiers)

| # | Differentiator | Vs. Vanta/Drata | Vs. OneTrust/AuditBoard/ServiceNow | Vs. SafeBase/Conveyor | Vs. Wiz/Lacework/Chainguard |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **OSS + Python + library-first** | None do this | None | None | None at GRC layer; only Snyk/Aqua/Sysdig/Anchore/Chainguard at adjacent security layer |
| 2 | **OSCAL-native** | None ship OSCAL output | None | None | Only RegScale (parity); not Wiz/Lacework/Prisma/CrowdStrike |
| 3 | **AI-optional** (works fully without LLM access) | Hard-wired AI dependency | All AI-core (Athena, Now Assist, watsonx) | AI-first by design | CSPM tied to telemetry; not relevant axis |
| 4 | **Air-gap-capable** | None deploy on-prem or air-gapped | OneTrust on-prem deprecated; rest cloud-only | All cloud-only | All cloud-telemetry-dependent by definition |
| 5 | **Sigstore + PEP 740 + SBOM applied to the GRC tool itself** | None publish signed SBOM for their platform | None | None | Parity-ish with Chainguard's signed-image philosophy, but Evidentia applies it to *the GRC tool*, not just images. **Genuine differentiator at the meta-layer.** |
| 6 | **Composite GitHub Action / CI-native** | SaaS dashboards; not pipeline-native | Workflow apps; not CI primitives | Same | Snyk/Aqua/Sysdig CI-native for *security scanning*; Evidentia CI-native for *compliance evidence* |
| 7 | **88 framework catalogs bundled** (95+ planned for v0.7.9 with FFIEC + OCC + SR 11-7 additions) | Vanta 35+ ([Vanta frameworks](https://www.vanta.com/products/additional-frameworks)), Drata 20+, Secureframe ~12, Sprinto 200+ (claim — but with documented uneven depth — see §6.4), Comp AI 25+ | OneTrust + ServiceNow + IBM cover hundreds via paid licensed regulatory libraries | N/A (trust center vendors don't ship catalogs) | RegScale claims 60+ (parity); CISO Assistant 130+ claimed (parity) |
| 8 | **PCAOB AS 1105 5/5 capability alignment** (NEW v0.7.8 differentiator) | None publish 5/5 alignment | None | None | None |

### 6.2 Where Evidentia is at parity (don't oversell)

- **AI-assisted control mapping** — Vanta AI Agent, SafeBase AI, RegScale all do this. Evidentia at parity, not advantage.
- **Multi-framework crosswalking** — Hyperproof's Hyperintelligence and Drata's framework engine are mature. Evidentia at 89 catalogs is at parity in coverage; quality of the crosswalk graph needs more validation.
- **Evidence collection from cloud APIs** — Tier 1 vendors and CSPM tools both do this well. Evidentia's collectors (AWS, GitHub Dependabot, IAM Access Analyzer) are at parity for the integrations shipped, behind on coverage breadth.
- **CycloneDX SBOM output** — Industry standard now (Anchore, Chainguard, Snyk). Parity, not ahead.
- **Sigstore/Rekor signing of releases** — Increasingly table-stakes (Chainguard pioneered, Anchore + others adopting). Parity.
- **Conventional commits + semver release automation** — Table-stakes in modern OSS. Parity.

### 6.3.1 Framework-count caveat (added v0.7.8)

Per Stream 1's findings on commercial GRC over-promising patterns: bare framework counts (e.g., "Sprinto 200+") hide deep unevenness — vendors typically have world-class SOC 2 / ISO 27001 coverage but checklist-only mapping with little automation for FFIEC, SR 11-7, FedRAMP, CMMC. PolicyCortex's CMMC analysis is explicit: SOC-2-grade evidence "is often not sufficient for a CMMC C3PAO assessor." Evidentia's 88 catalogs claim should always be qualified with **redistribution-tier accounting** (Tier A 31 frameworks verbatim public domain + Tier D 21 statutory + Tier C 20 licensed-stubs + Tier B 4 threat catalogs at the v0.7.0 base, +6 since) and the **catalog-import flow for Tier-C licensed copies** (`evidentia catalog import` for ISO 27001, PCI DSS 4.0.1, etc.).

### 6.3.2 The ten honest gaps (intentionally surfaced)

These are the gaps that will get a sales-eng on a Vanta/Drata bake-off to win, and that messaging should not paper over:

| # | Gap | Status / planned remediation |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **No customer-facing trust-center module** (SafeBase / Conveyor / Vanta Trust Center are now table-stakes for B2B SaaS buyers) | v0.8.x candidate — could be a `evidentia trust-center` static-site generator that emits Sigstore-attested trust pages from Evidentia's own evidence |
| 2 | **No questionnaire-fill AI** (Conveyor's Sue, Drata/SafeBase, Vanta Questionnaire Automation are mature) | Won't ship — explicit positioning choice; Evidentia is library-first, not RFP-fill-first |
| 3 | **Integration breadth** (Vanta has 375+; Evidentia has 5 collectors today) | Roadmap: Okta, Azure, GCP collectors planned; community-pluggable collector pattern is documented |
| 4 | **No formalized auditor partnerships / no in-platform auditor handoff** | v0.8.x candidate — `evidentia oscal export --bundle-for-auditor` workflow + curated partnership list |
| 5 | **No published Forrester Wave / Gartner Magic Quadrant inclusion** | Realistic only after a commercial sponsor exists; OSS projects don't typically get on these without one |
| 6 | **No third-party risk (TPRM) module** | Composable — Evidentia could ingest BitSight / SecurityScorecard data via collector pattern; not a v0.8 priority |
| 7 | **No risk register / ERM primitive** (AuditBoard, Riskonnect, MetricStream lead with ERM) | Honest framing: Evidentia's "risk statements" are NIST SP 800-30 narratives, not a Riskonnect-class ERM register. Could add a lightweight `evidentia risk register` in v0.9.x |
| 8 | **No reference customers / logo wall / ARR** | Pre-traction. v0.8 priority: get 5 named adopters (consultancies, FedRAMP CSPs, defense contractors) |
| 9 | **No formalized SOC 2 / ISO 27001 of Evidentia itself** | OSS can't *be* SOC 2 compliant (it's not an entity). Mitigation: publish a formal threat model + supply-chain attestation roadmap; if a hosted-service offering ships, pursue SOC 2 Type II for that |
| 10 | **No IPO/exit narrative for vendor-longevity-paranoid buyers** | Mitigation: lean into "OSS = no acquisition risk; the code outlives any company"; cite GovReady-Q / Olive AI / Lacework valuation collapses as cautionary tales |

## 7. The eight unclaimed gaps Evidentia fills (refreshed v0.7.8)

> **Section summary.** Cross-stream research as of May 2026 surfaced
> eight structural gaps in the OSS GRC ecosystem that no project
> currently fills, and that Evidentia's existing architecture maps
> directly onto. v0.7.8 added three new gaps to the list (HF GRC eval
> suite, Sigstore-attested AI provenance, SR-11-7-replacement
> framework opening) and merged the GovReady vacuum into the broader
> AGPL-alternative gap. **These are the differentiation spine.**

1. **A maintained Python OSCAL library.** `oscal-pydantic` is 2+ years stale (last push 2024-04-06, 23 stars). Compliance-trestle is opinionated workflow software, not a library. Nothing else fills the `pip install evidentia-core; from evidentia_core import GapAnalyzer` shape.

2. **Bundled multi-framework crosswalk dataset.** NIST publishes 800-53 in OSCAL. CIS publishes Controls v8. ISO 27001 OSCAL ports are fragmented and unofficial. **Nobody bundles 88+ frameworks with vetted crosswalks** (Evidentia at v0.7.8; growing to 95+ in v0.7.9 with FFIEC + OCC + SR 11-7 additions). Evidentia could publish `evidentia-catalogs` as a separate Apache/CC0 repo and become the *de facto* multi-framework reference dataset, the way `oscal-content` is for NIST 800-53 alone. Includes the GovReady-Q vacated niche (210 stars; no meaningful work since 2024).

3. **Apache-2.0 alternative to AGPL CISO Assistant + Comp AI.** Many enterprises (defense contractors, SaaS vendors who would distribute the code, federal sub-primes) categorically refuse AGPL. There is no permissively-licensed full-stack GRC OSS today with active development. **Sharpened in v0.7.8**: CISO Assistant pulls 4,008 stars + daily commits + dual-license commercial paid SKUs; Comp AI raised $20M Series A from Khosla/Rabois Feb 2026 + $2.6M earlier from OSS Capital + Grand Ventures — the AGPL incumbents are well-capitalized and well-staffed. Evidentia's Apache 2.0 + Sigstore + SLSA L3 is the differentiable moat against them.

4. **Standardized bridge from CSPM/IaC scan results → OSCAL Assessment Results.** Prowler/Checkov/Trivy emit JSON. Nobody has canonical mappers to OSCAL `assessment-results` / `observation`. Evidentia's collectors layer is the right shape to fill this. **MITRE/saf** does heterogeneous-scan-to-OHDF — Evidentia could absorb the pattern.

5. **Library-callable evidence chain with cryptographic provenance.** Evidentia's Sigstore/Rekor signing of evidence + CycloneDX SBOM + PEP 740 attestations + cosign container signing + SLSA L3 build provenance make it the only OSS GRC tool that puts supply-chain integrity *on the evidence itself*, not just on the binary distribution. **Cross-stream confirmation**: Stream 2 + Stream 5 both report no commercial GRC vendor stores AI provenance with cryptographic attestation; MAIF (Nov 2025; arXiv 2511.15097) is the closest academic prior art. Evidentia already ships PEP 740 + SLSA L3; extending Sigstore-signing to AI invocations + risk statements (planned v0.8.0) is mostly plumbing.

6. **DFAH-style determinism harness for AI compliance outputs (NEW v0.7.8).** Khatchadourian (arXiv 2601.15322, March 2026) names this exact framework. **No commercial GRC vendor ships it.** Vanta + Drata + Optro + OneTrust + Workiva + ServiceNow + Anecdotes all shipped some form of AI agent + MCP + citation-grounded output between Sept 2025 and April 2026, but **none ship deterministic-replay verification**. PCAOB AS 1105 + Generative AI Spotlight (July 2024) requires immutable audit trails + human-in-the-loop verification for AI-influenced audit information; Evidentia's planned v0.8.0 P0.1 `evidentia eval` CLI is the precise affordance.

7. **First-class Policy Reasoning Traces (PRT) as auditable artifact (NEW v0.7.8).** Imperial & Tayyar Madabushi (arXiv 2509.23291, Sept 2025; University of Bath) names this framework. Commercial vendors ship "citation-grounded answers" (Vanta Agent claim) and "AI-assisted form fills" (GRC 2020 March 2026 critique) but not PRT as a first-class queryable artifact. Evidentia's planned v0.8.0 P0.2 `evidentia risk generate --emit-trace` mode is the precise affordance.

8. **SR-11-7-replacement model-risk framework primitive (NEW v0.7.8).** SR 11-7 superseded by SR 26-02 + OCC Bulletin 2026-13a April 17 2026; new guidance **explicitly excludes generative AI and agentic AI**. Banks need a framework now; agencies promised future RFI but no timeline. Evidentia's planned **v0.7.9 model-risk module** (`evidentia model-risk doc generate` with SR 11-7 §III.A/B/C documentation templates + SR-11-7-traceable AI invocations + Sigstore-signed `(risk_statement, model_inventory_ref)` link) ships before any commercial GRC vendor offers a model-risk-management primitive at this depth. **Strongest single audit-defensibility positioning Evidentia can make for financial-services + federal customers.**

9. **Standardized GRC LLM eval suite on Hugging Face (NEW v0.7.8).** HF Hub keyword searches confirmed across Streams 4 + 5 (May 2026): "OSCAL controls dataset" / "SOC2 GRC audit regulatory" / "compliance OSCAL NIST" all return **zero results**. Adjacent benchmarks exist (AIReg-Bench EU AI Act; CNFinBench finance; OmniCompliance-100K; LegalBench legal-reasoning) but none target NIST 800-53 / OSCAL emit / cross-framework crosswalk reasoning. Evidentia's planned **v0.8.0 P2.3 GRC eval suite** (50-200 manually-validated risk-statement gold-standard examples + per-control evaluation harness) would be **first-in-class on HF Hub** + becomes the *de facto* citable evaluation standard.

### 8.1 The four forcing-function dates (Q4 2026 convergence)

| Date | Mandate | Implication for Evidentia |
|---|---|---|
| **2025-03-31** (binding all 2026 assessments) | **PCI DSS 4.0.1** — 51 of 64 future-dated requirements (incl. MFA for all CDE access under 8.3.1, e-commerce script-integrity 6.4.3/11.6.1) became binding; no grace period | All 2026 assessments use v4.0.1; bundled PCI DSS catalog needs to be on v4.0.1 (Tier C) |
| **2026-05** target window | **HIPAA Security Rule final rule** (NPRM published 2025-01-06; OCR's regulatory agenda lists May 2026; ~4,700+ comments closed 2025-03-07; once final, 240 days to comply) | Significant uncertainty under new administration; bundled HIPAA Security catalog must be ready for revision |
| **2026-08-02** | **EU AI Act Article 50 transparency obligations + Annex III high-risk systems** (potentially deferred to Dec 2027 under Digital Omnibus) | First likely AI Act fine; ISO 42001 + EU AI Act crosswalks become valuable |
| **2026-09-11** | **EU CRA reporting obligations** — 24/72-hour incident + 14-day vulnerability reporting for any digital product placed on the EU market (CRA in force since 2024-12-10; full obligations including SBOMs apply 2027-12-11) | Hard demand spike for SBOM, vulnerability-tracking, incident-disclosure tooling; Evidentia's CycloneDX SBOM + collector pattern + audit-event stream is precisely positioned |
| **2026-09-30** | **FedRAMP 20x** — Rev 5 transition target; machine-readable (OSCAL) authorization data mandatory for CSPs to retain status; FedRAMP Ready also retires 2026-07-28 | OSCAL becomes mandatory; vendors lacking OSCAL face revocation risk; 90%+ of incumbents still don't natively emit OSCAL |
| **2026-10-01** | **Maryland MODPA** effective — strictest US privacy law (sale-of-sensitive-data prohibition + "reasonably necessary" data-minimization standard; $10K/violation, $25K/repeat penalties) | Bundled Tier-D state privacy laws now total 19 active in 2026; MODPA new high-water mark |
| **2026-11-10** | **CMMC Phase 2** — Level 2 C3PAO third-party assessments mandatory for most DOD contractors handling CUI (Phase 1 self-assess became binding 2025-11-10) | **~300,000 DOD contractors need 800-171 evidence collection**; Vanta/Drata at $30K+/yr unaffordable for most; Evidentia's free Apache 2.0 + air-gap support is the obvious fit |
| **2026-11-10 to 2027-11-10** | DORA first full enforcement year — ESAs published list of **19 Critical ICT Third-Party Providers** (CTPPs) on 2025-11-18 (incl. AWS, Azure, GCP, Bloomberg, LSEG); 2026 Register of Information cycle uses 2025-12-31 reference data | EU CTPP oversight active; DORA-aware GRC tooling has captured customer base |
| **2026-Q1+** | **NIS2** — 21 of 27 EU member states transposed (Mar 2026); Commission issued reasoned opinion to **19 member states** on 2025-05-07 for incomplete transposition | Fragmented enforcement landscape; multi-jurisdictional crosswalks valuable |

### 8.2 Market validation that GRC is hot (refreshed May 2026)

- **GRC = #1 sub-sector in cybersecurity M&A 2025**: 82 deals, five-year peak (SecurityWeek). Tempo accelerating: **38 cybersecurity M&A deals in March 2026 alone** ([Tech Insider](https://tech-insider.org/cybersecurity-ma-consolidation-2026/)).

### 8.3 OSS GRC inflection points

- **OSCAL Foundation formally launched February 10, 2025** with Brian Ruf and Stephen Banghart as coordinators — neutral governance for the OSCAL ecosystem
- **RegScale donated OSCAL Hub to the foundation December 2025** — active commercial-to-OSS migration in this exact space
- **FedRAMP 20x took off**: 114 authorizations in FY25 (more than 2× FY24), median time-to-authorization down from ~12 months to ~5 weeks; Phase 2 pilots launched late 2025
- **CSA launched Compliance Automation Revolution (CAR) at RSA 2025** with Google, Oracle, Salesforce, Deloitte Italy

### 8.4 Why this matters for Evidentia specifically

- **OSCAL-native, library-first** hits the September 2026 FedRAMP OSCAL mandate at a moment when 90%+ of incumbents still don't natively emit OSCAL (Vanta added export Feb 2026 for FedRAMP 20x submissions only — first major commercial vendor to ship OSCAL export)
- **Open-source + sovereign deploy** serves EU customers facing DORA enforcement + 19 CTPP oversight (who push toward EU-hosted or on-prem) and ~300,000 DOD contractors facing CMMC Phase 2 (who can't afford SaaS GRC at $30K+/yr)
- **Sigstore + air-gap refusal** aligns with EO 14306 retained provisions and Defense Unicorns / Big Bang / Platform One patterns
- **CycloneDX SBOM + collector pattern** aligns with CISA 2025 SBOM minimum elements update + FDA medical-device 524B + **EU CRA September 2026 reporting obligations**
- **Vendor M&A creates customer flight risk** — Optro rebrand, Drata-SafeBase, Diligent-3rdRisk, OneTrust → likely PE buyout, Wiz-Google: enterprise customers are nervous about platform stability. **Open-source = no acquisition risk**
- **Federal SBOM tailwind weakened (OMB M-26-05 January 2026 rescinded mandatory self-attestation)** but EU CRA more than offsets globally
- **3PAO scarcity persists** ([GAO-24-106395](https://cabrilloclub.com/insights/fedramp-20x-explained)): FedRAMP Moderate authorization backlogs averaging 22 months with 200+ vendors in queue. FedRAMP 20x targeted at 2-3x more vendors authorized by 2027 with end-to-end pilot costs of $500K-$1.5M (vs $2M-$5M legacy) — **automation/OSCAL machine-readable evidence is the only way the math works**
- **cATO momentum** ([DoD CIO Continuous Authorization Implementation Guide](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Library/DoDCIO-ContinuousAuthorizationImplementationGuide.pdf)): Zero Trust target levels mandated by end-FY27; AI/ML-driven assessment automation explicitly called out by the Zero Trust PfMO
- **PCAOB AS 1105 + Generative AI Spotlight (July 2024)** is the regulator-recognized framework for AI in audit reports — Evidentia's v0.7.1 (audit trails) + planned v0.8.0 (DFAH + PRT) hits all 5 required capabilities

## 9. Industry headwinds

> **Section summary (refreshed v0.7.8 May 2026).** Eight structural
> headwinds, three of which are NEW since v0.7.0: (NEW) AI feature
> commoditization across all GRC vendors Q1 2026; (NEW) federal SBOM
> tailwind weakened by OMB M-26-05 January 2026; (NEW) AGPL competitor
> velocity (CISO Assistant + Comp AI well-capitalized + daily
> commits); plus the 5 carry-forward headwinds: AI moats at scale;
> OSCAL adoption lagging the mandate; PE consolidation creating
> gravity wells; regulatory complexity demanding maintenance; AI hype
> risk. None is fatal but each shapes positioning choices.

1. **Vanta + Drata + Optro + OneTrust have AI moats from scale.** Hundreds of integrations, customer corpora to fine-tune AI agents, 35+ pre-mapped frameworks. An OSS tool with 8 evidence-collection surfaces looks small by comparison. **Mitigation**: lean into OSCAL/sovereign/air-gap/cryptographic-evidence-attestation angles where SaaS can't follow; federate (let users plug Evidentia into existing SaaS GRC via the v0.7.8 Tableau / Power BI publish surfaces); position as the substrate that AI agents validate against (signed evidence, OSCAL artifacts, DFAH replay).

2. **NEW: AI feature commoditization (Q1 2026 universal launches).** Vanta, Drata, Optro, OneTrust, Hyperproof, Workiva, ServiceNow, Anecdotes all shipped agentic AI + MCP server + citation-grounded LLM output between Sept 2025 and April 2026. **The differentiation is collapsing rapidly** into eval rigor, audit-trail quality, and OSS license posture — not "we have AI." **Mitigation**: accelerate the v0.8.0 DFAH + PRT + MCP + plugin-contract differentiators before they become parity items.

3. **OSCAL adoption lags the mandate.** Zero of 100+ FedRAMP Rev5 authorizations in 2025 used OSCAL. The forcing function is real but vendors lag. **Vanta added OSCAL export Feb 2026 for FedRAMP 20x submissions only** — first major commercial vendor to ship OSCAL export at all. **Risk**: the market educates slowly; revenue follows mandate enforcement, not mandate publication. **Mitigation**: be patient; the September + November 2026 dates will pull the market forward; Evidentia is OSCAL-native and 18 months ahead of incumbent emit capability.

4. **NEW: Federal SBOM tailwind weakened (OMB M-26-05, January 2026).** [Davis Wright Tremaine analysis](https://www.dwt.com/blogs/privacy--security-law-blog/2026/02/omb-changes-course-on-software-security): M-26-05 rescinded M-22-18 + M-23-16, removing the mandatory standardized self-attestation form and shifting to risk-based agency discretion. SBOMs still recommended for cloud-runtime production environments. EO 14028 remains in force. **Mitigation**: EU CRA reporting obligations Sept 11 2026 more than offset globally; positioning toward EU-regulated digital-product manufacturers + US cloud-runtime SBOM (still mandated under M-26-05) carries the demand.

5. **Big-vendor PE consolidation will accelerate.** Hg, Vista, Thoma Bravo, Blackstone, KKR, Silver Lake are all active in GRC M&A. They'll bundle, cross-sell, undercut. OSS competes on different axes (sovereignty, transparency, cost) but loses on inertia and procurement gravity.

6. **NEW: AGPL OSS competitor velocity.** CISO Assistant (intuitem; 4,008 stars; daily commits; well-staffed French startup; 130+ frameworks) + Comp AI ($20M Series A Feb 2026 from Khosla / Keith Rabois; AGPL; 1,535 stars; daily commits; "AI-native" positioning) are well-capitalized and ship-velocity-matched. **Mitigation**: Evidentia's permissive Apache 2.0 + Sigstore + SLSA L3 + bundled multi-framework catalogs + cryptographic evidence chain is the differentiable moat against them; the gap won't naturally close because adding cryptographic provenance + OSCAL emit + signed-evidence-bundle surfaces requires substantial rearchitecture.

7. **Regulatory complexity itself.** 19 US state privacy laws (Maryland MODPA new high-water mark 2026-10-01), NIS2's 27 EU member-state transpositions (21 done; 6 outstanding with 19 reasoned-opinion infringement actions), India DPDP phasing, EU AI Act tiers, China cross-border, FFIEC CAT sunset (Aug 2025) requiring CRI Profile / CSF migration — keeping catalogs current is a real engineering cost. SaaS vendors have compliance teams; OSS relies on community + maintainer effort. **Mitigation**: bundled-catalog-as-a-product approach (the v0.8.0 P2.2 `evidentia-catalogs` standalone repo split); community contribution channel for Tier-D statutory frameworks (uncopyrightable).

8. **AI hype risk + Delve scandal cautionary baseline.** "Agentic GRC" is the hottest framing at every conference. An OSS tool that's "just a library" may look unfashionable to enterprise buyers chasing the AI checkbox. **March 2026 Delve scandal** (493/494 SOC 2 reports byte-identical; whistleblower disclosure DeepDelver; FTC + DOJ False Claims Act exposure) is the precise counter-narrative — "AI-powered" without rigor failed at scale. **Counter-positioning**: cite GRC 2020 March 2026 critique (most "agentic AI" features are AI-assisted form fills, not bounded-autonomy multi-step orchestrators); cite Magesh / Ho et al. (Stanford 2025) measured **17–33% hallucination rates** in commercial RAG-based legal research tools marketed as "hallucination-free"; cite PCAOB AS 1105 + Generative AI Spotlight as the regulator-recognized framework. Frame Evidentia's AI-optional posture as **deterministic-where-it-must-be, AI-where-it-helps**. Khatchadourian DFAH paper (March 2026, arXiv 2601.15322) provides the technical vocabulary.

9. **CMMC backlash possibility.** If Phase 2 (Nov 2026) gets delayed (it has been pushed before), the urgency tailwind softens. Mitigation: don't bet messaging exclusively on CMMC; diversify across the four forcing-function dates and the regulatory-vacuum opportunity (SR 11-7 → SR 26-02 model-risk gap).

10. **Federal procurement budget pressure.** 2025-2026 saw new administration's DOGE-driven cuts to consultants and contractors hitting major federal-services-sector stocks Feb 2025; FY26 continuing resolutions have squeezed civilian-agency + consultant compliance-tool spend ([Nextgov — agency consultant culling](https://www.nextgov.com/acquisition/2025/02/trump-administration-asks-agencies-cull-consultants/403345/)). Mitigation: free Apache 2.0 OSS is precisely the budget-pressure-friendly answer.

11. **OSS sustainability fragility.** Post-xz-Utils backdoor (CVE-2024-3094), Linux Foundation reported April 2026 that social-engineering attacks against OSS maintainers continue at scale ([WebProNews / Linux Foundation alarm](https://www.webpronews.com/the-xz-backdoor-was-just-the-beginning-linux-foundation-sounds-the-alarm-on-social-engineering-attacks-targeting-open-source/)). For OSS GRC tools this is reputational risk by association.

12. **License-shift risk** ([HashiCorp BSL Aug 2023](https://www.hashicorp.com/license-faq), [Elastic SSPL 2021](https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-aws)). HashiCorp BSL + Elastic SSPL precedent remains the cautionary base rate. No major OSS GRC project has flipped licenses in the 2024-2026 window — but the playbook is well-established and the temptation grows as VC-backed OSS-adjacent platforms scale (CISO Assistant + Comp AI both AGPL+commercial; either could flip incrementally). Mitigation: Apache 2.0 commitment is itself a competitive moat; surface it explicitly in positioning copy.

## 10. Positioning frame — "Terraform / dbt of GRC"

> **Section summary.** The positioning frame that wins is **"Terraform
> / dbt of GRC"**: a library-first, CI-native primitive that
> orchestrates evidence and frameworks, rather than a SaaS dashboard
> you pay $14k/yr/framework for. This sidesteps the Vanta/Drata
> bake-off Evidentia would lose, and competes inside the
> dev-tools-for-compliance trend Chainguard, Snyk, and Anchore
> validated.

### 10.1 Why this frame works

- **It moves Evidentia out of a category Vanta/Drata own** (SaaS GRC dashboards) and into a category that has no incumbent (CI-native compliance primitives)
- **It signals to the right buyer** — security engineers and platform teams who already think in "policy as code", "infrastructure as code", "security as code" — that Evidentia speaks their idiom
- **It implies the right deployment model** — `pip install` + `evidentia gap analyze` in CI, not "request a demo" + "schedule a 6-month rollout"
- **It validates the positioning** by analogy: Terraform didn't beat AWS Console; it gave engineers a primitive layer that orchestrates AWS + Azure + GCP. dbt didn't beat Tableau; it gave analysts a primitive layer that orchestrates SQL transformations. Evidentia doesn't beat Vanta; it gives compliance engineers a primitive layer that orchestrates frameworks + evidence + risk

### 10.2 Pull-quote candidates for marketing

> *"The puck is moving from PDFs of evidence toward signed JSON streams of evidence. Evidentia is sitting almost exactly where the regulatory and market vectors are converging in the next 12–18 months."*

> *"AI is now table-stakes in commercial GRC, not differentiation. The new wedge is evidence quality, traceability, and auditor acceptance."*

> *"GRC has been waiting for its Terraform moment. Vanta and Drata are the AWS Consoles of compliance. Evidentia is the IaC layer underneath."*

### 10.3 The supporting messaging hierarchy

- **Primary**: "OSCAL-native, library-first, supply-chain-hardened GRC primitive — the Terraform / dbt of GRC"
- **Secondary**: "Open-source, Python, AI-optional, air-gap-capable. 82 frameworks bundled. Sigstore-signed evidence."
- **Tertiary** (proof points): "All 10 BLOCKER items in the enterprise-grade checklist closed at v0.7.0. PEP 740 attestations on every wheel. CycloneDX SBOM on every release. trestle conformance test in CI."
- **Honest disclaimer** (builds credibility): "Not a Vanta replacement for SOC-2-only buyers — those want the dashboard + auditor handoff. Evidentia is for engineers + platform teams who want compliance as a primitive."

## 11. AI posture

> **Section summary (refreshed v0.7.8 May 2026).** Evidentia's current
> AI stack (LiteLLM + Instructor + Pydantic risk-statement schemas
> with full GenerationContext provenance per v0.7.1) is the right OSS
> production stack as of May 2026. **Foundational AI patterns are now
> table-stakes universally** — every credible GRC vendor shipped
> agentic AI + MCP server + citation-grounded LLM output between Sept
> 2025 and April 2026. **MCP first-mover window for OSCAL primitives
> is CLOSED** — IBM `compliance-trestle-mcp`, AWS Labs
> `mcp-server-for-oscal` (12+ tools), Vanta MCP (April 2026), Drata
> MCP, Optro MCP all live. **Wide open** for SR-11-7 / FFIEC / SBOM /
> TPRM-not-in-Vanta-silo / continuous-compliance-monitoring MCPs.
> **HF Hub keyword searches return ZERO results for OSCAL/NIST 800-53/
> SOC 2 datasets** — Evidentia's planned v0.8.0 P2.3 GRC eval suite
> would be **first-in-class**. **PCAOB AS 1105 + Generative AI Spotlight
> requires 5 capabilities; Evidentia's v0.7.1 + planned v0.8.0 hits
> all 5** — strongest single positioning claim. **The single highest-
> leverage AI feature Evidentia ships next remains DFAH determinism
> harness** (no commercial GRC vendor offers it; Khatchadourian arXiv
> 2601.15322 March 2026 names it by exact terminology).

### 11.1 Foundational patterns (table-stakes; Evidentia at parity)

- **RAG over policy corpus for Q&A** — every commercial vendor and OSS project ships it
- **Auto-fill of security questionnaires with cited sources** — converged at ~95% first-pass accuracy (Conveyor, SafeBase, Vanta, Iris, Inventive)
- **Continuous controls monitoring with LLM-summarized failures** — Drata + Vanta + Hyperproof
- **Crosswalk / control-mapping via LLM embeddings** — Hyperproof "Suggested Links Agent", Optro Accelerate
- **AI-generated policy drafts** — every SOC-2 platform
- **Vendor SOC 2 PDF parsing** — Black Kite, Whistic, ProcessUnity, Vanta TPRM Agent, Drata Agentic TPRM
- **Pydantic / structured-output schemas as default LLM I/O** — Instructor crossed 3M monthly downloads (Evidentia uses this)
- **Trust Center as AI-published artifact** — SafeBase reference architecture; OpenAI's trust portal runs on it

### 11.2 Bleeding-edge patterns (now mostly shipped Q1 2026)

- **Multi-agent / agentic GRC suites** — **shipped at scale Q1 2026** by Vanta, Drata, Optro, OneTrust, Workiva, Hyperproof, ServiceNow, Anecdotes. Pattern: every credible incumbent ships (1) MCP server, (2) citation-grounded LLM output, (3) agentic-with-checkpoint orchestration.
- **MCP-served GRC data to general-purpose LLM clients** — **shipped April 2026**. Vanta remote MCP server (April 15 2026, public preview), Drata MCP server (RSAC 2026), Optro MCP server with role-based permissions + audit controls + role propagation from human-IAM into agent layer, IBM `compliance-trestle-mcp` (oscal-compass), AWS Labs `mcp-server-for-oscal` (FastMCP 2.6+, 12+ tools incl. `list_oscal_models`, `get_oscal_schema`, `query_oscal_documentation`, `list_catalog_controls`, `list_ssp_components`). **CIMD (Client ID Metadata Documents) is now shipped + default** in MCP 2025-11-25 spec — promoted from RFC, replacing Dynamic Client Registration; FastMCP ≥ 2.6, Microsoft C# SDK v1.0 (March 2026), Claude Code, Claude.ai, VS Code all live.
- **First-mover MCP window status (May 2026)**:
  - **CLOSED** for OSCAL primitives — IBM trestle, AWS Labs, Vanta, Drata, Optro all live
  - **WIDE OPEN** for: policy-as-code enforcement MCP, comprehensive vulnerability/SBOM MCP, third-party-risk MCP outside Vanta/Drata silos, HIPAA-specific MCP, **FFIEC/SR-11-7 MCP** (precise opening per v0.7.9 plan), continuous-compliance-monitoring MCP
- **Anthropic Computer Use for browser-agent questionnaire completion** — being demoed; not yet GA in GRC products
- **Multimodal evidence validation** (DSE / MMDocRAG papers) — Optro pre-fills questionnaires from SOC 2 PDFs (document understanding only); **no vendor does true vision-LLM screenshot validation**. Open opportunity.
- **Determinism-replay for audit defensibility (DFAH)** — DFAH framework defines the problem (Khatchadourian March 2026); **NO commercial GRC vendor ships this**. Evidentia's v0.7.1 GenerationContext (model + temperature + prompt-hash + run-id) is the substrate; planned v0.8.0 `evidentia eval` is the affordance.
- **Cryptographic provenance for AI invocations** — **NO commercial GRC vendor stores AI provenance with cryptographic attestation**. MAIF (Nov 2025; arXiv 2511.15097) is the closest academic prior art. Evidentia already attests packages via PEP 740 + SLSA L3 since v0.7.1; extending to AI invocations is mostly plumbing.
- **Live-attestation Trust Center consumption by buyer agents** — Drata Agentic TPRM does this against SafeBase Trust Centers; Vanta Customer Trust Agent ingests vendor Trust Centers
- **Insurance pricing tied to AI-governance compliance** (StackAware × Armilla AI)
- **Frontier model FedRAMP authorization** (May 2026): Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.7 (FedRAMP High via Bedrock GovCloud); OpenAI GPT-4o / o1 / o3 series (FedRAMP 20x Moderate); Azure OpenAI (DoD IL-6 Feb 2026, Top Secret); Gemini for Government + Perplexity Enterprise Pro (FedRAMP 20x Low Jan 2026). Evidentia's LiteLLM-routed AI works against any of these.

### 11.2.1 PCAOB AS 1105 + Generative AI Spotlight alignment (NEW v0.7.8)

PCAOB amended AS 1105 in 2024 to require auditors test either AI-influenced information directly or controls over it. The **PCAOB Generative AI Spotlight** (July 2024, [PCAOB.org](https://pcaobus.org/documents/generative-ai-spotlight.pdf)) defines the regulator-recognized framework for AI in audit reports. **Five required capabilities; Evidentia's v0.7.1 + planned v0.8.0 hits all 5**:

| PCAOB requirement | Evidentia surface | Status |
|---|---|---|
| (1) Prompt + response capture | GenerationContext.prompt_hash + audit-event AI_RISK_GENERATED | **Shipped v0.7.1 ✓** |
| (2) Model-version tracking | GenerationContext.model + temperature | **Shipped v0.7.1 ✓** |
| (3) Human-in-the-loop verification | DFAH harness (`evidentia eval`) gates determinism + faithfulness pre-emit | Planned v0.8.0 P0.1 |
| (4) Immutable audit trails | Sigstore-signed risk-statement artifacts + Rekor transparency log entries | Planned v0.8.0 P0.4 |
| (5) Explainability documentation | PRT mode (`evidentia risk generate --emit-trace`) emits clause-cited reasoning per claim | Planned v0.8.0 P0.2 |

**This is the strongest single audit-defensibility positioning claim Evidentia can make in the v0.8.0 cycle.** Cite PCAOB AS 1105 + Generative AI Spotlight as the regulator-recognized framework Evidentia is purpose-built to satisfy.

### 11.3 The 8 ranked OSS contribution opportunities for Evidentia

1. **DFAH-style determinism harness for risk-statement generation** — implement decision-determinism + faithfulness + replay-equivalence metrics on Evidentia's Instructor calls. Ship as `evidentia eval` CLI. **No commercial vendor offers this; it's the most defensible auditor-facing claim Evidentia can make.** (Cite: arXiv 2601.15322)
2. **Policy Reasoning Traces (PRT) integration** for risk statements — emit explicit chain-of-thought traces alongside each risk statement, citing exact policy clauses. (Cite: arXiv 2509.23291)
3. **Open, citable risk-statement benchmark dataset** on Hugging Face — 200 manually-validated (control, threat-context, ideal-risk-statement) triples across NIST SP 800-53 / ISO 27001 Annex A / SOC 2 TSC. Becomes the *de facto* standard.
4. **OSCAL-native input/output** — Evidentia already does this; aligns with September 2026 federal mandate
5. **Evidence groundedness gate** — every risk statement must cite an extracted evidence span; refuse to emit otherwise. Borrow Ragas + DeepEval triad scoring.
6. **MCP server exposing Evidentia's GRC store** — instantly puts Evidentia in a category alongside Anecdotes and CISO Assistant for Claude/ChatGPT users
7. **Sigstore-signed risk-statement artifacts + log schema** — extend existing Sigstore signing to every risk statement so evidence is tamper-evident in audits
8. **Document Screenshot Embedding (DSE)-based screenshot evidence validator** — long-term moat; today only academic (arXiv 2406.11251)

### 11.4 What Evidentia should NOT try to ship

- **Vendor-questionnaire auto-fill** (Conveyor / Iris / Vanta own this category; commodity AI feature now)
- **Trust Center hosting** (SafeBase / Drata own; Evidentia could ship a static-site generator alternative but not a hosted product)
- **Reg-change monitoring** (Compliance.ai, Norm AI specialty; deep regulatory taxonomy required)

### 11.5 Hugging Face compliance datasets that exist (refreshed May 2026)

Cross-stream verified searches (Streams 4 + 5; HF MCP `paper_search` + `hub_repo_search`). The HF Hub compliance surface is **strikingly thin** — this is the most important finding for Evidentia's eval-suite strategy:

- [`ethanolivertroy/nist-cybersecurity-training`](https://hf.co/datasets/ethanolivertroy/nist-cybersecurity-training) — 3.4K downloads; claims to be the largest open-source NIST cybersecurity training dataset; includes CSWP and security-controls
- [`ethanolivertroy/nist-publications-raw`](https://hf.co/datasets/ethanolivertroy/nist-publications-raw) — 24.4K downloads; raw NIST PDF corpus
- [`AlicanKiraz0/Cybersecurity-Dataset-Fenrir-v2.1`](https://hf.co/datasets/AlicanKiraz0/Cybersecurity-Dataset-Fenrir-v2.1) — 6.6K downloads; 99,870 instruction-tuning triples; defensive-cybersecurity focus
- [`Trendyol/Trendyol-Cybersecurity-Instruction-Tuning-Dataset`](https://hf.co/datasets/Trendyol/Trendyol-Cybersecurity-Instruction-Tuning-Dataset) — 3.4K downloads; 53,202 instruction examples
- [`Vanessasml/cybersecurity_32k_instruction_input_output`](https://hf.co/datasets/Vanessasml/cybersecurity_32k_instruction_input_output) — 590 downloads; NIST taxonomy + ITC EBA IT risk
- [`Sid-tf/TPRM-compliance`](https://hf.co/datasets/Sid-tf/TPRM-compliance) — directly relevant to v0.7.9 TPRM module
- [`Wenbin Hu et al. 2026 *OmniCompliance-100K*`](https://hf.co/papers/2603.13933) — 12,985 rules, 106,009 cases across 74 regulations (March 2026); most ambitious adjacent benchmark; candidate baseline
- [`camlsys/AIReg-Bench`](https://hf.co/papers/2510.01474) — 300 EU AI Act compliance excerpts (Marino et al. Oct 2025)
- [`Finance-Agentic-AI/Investing-Compliance`](https://hf.co/datasets/Finance-Agentic-AI/Investing-Compliance) — 22 downloads; very early stage
- [`nguha/legalbench`](https://hf.co/datasets/nguha/legalbench) — 162 legal-reasoning tasks (Stanford CodeX; canonical legal LLM benchmark)

**Searches that returned ZERO results**: "OSCAL controls dataset" (sorted by trending), "SOC2 GRC audit regulatory" (sorted by downloads), "compliance OSCAL NIST".

**Legal/regulatory fine-tuned models** (most-downloaded compliance-adjacent — none compliance-specific):
- [`Equall/Saul-7B-Instruct-v1`](https://hf.co/Equall/Saul-7B-Instruct-v1) — 5.2K downloads, 111 likes, canonical legal LLM (Mistral-based, MIT)
- [`Equall/SaulLM-54B-Instruct`](https://hf.co/Equall/SaulLM-54B-Instruct) — 158 downloads, Mixtral-based
- [`isaacus/open-australian-legal-llm`](https://hf.co/isaacus/open-australian-legal-llm) — 271 downloads
- BloombergGPT — finance-domain, never released to HF Hub publicly

### 11.6 HF gaps Evidentia could fill (genuine first-in-class opportunity)

- **No open SOC 2 / ISO 27001 control-mapping dataset**
- **No open NIST 800-30 risk-statement generation benchmark**
- **No open OSCAL emit conformance benchmark**
- **No open NIST 800-53 ↔ SOC 2 ↔ ISO 27001 ↔ CIS v8.1 cross-walk benchmark**
- **No open evidence-validation benchmark**
- **No open OSCAL-fluent fine-tuned model**
- **No open multimodal evidence (screenshot+log+PDF) compliance dataset**

**Evidentia's planned v0.8.0 P2.3 GRC eval suite** (50-200 manually-validated risk-statement gold-standard examples + per-control evaluation harness across NIST 800-53 / ISO 27001 Annex A / SOC 2 TSC) is **first-in-class on HF Hub** + becomes the *de facto* citable evaluation standard for any LLM-on-GRC research. Recommended academic submission venue: **JOSS (Journal of Open Source Software)** — open access, peer-reviewed, ~12 weeks submission-to-publication, OSI-approved-license requirement met by Apache 2.0, AI-disclosure standard met by Evidentia's existing AI-attribution README pattern. Then an AISec / OpenSSF Research Forum workshop paper. NIST CSWP collaboration as long-tail aspiration once OSCAL-AI integration matures.

### 12.2 Top 5 voices to cite in Evidentia's positioning copy (refreshed)

| # | Voice | Cited work (URL) | Why it supports Evidentia |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Allan Friedman, CISA SBOM lead** | ["The State of SBOM," ETSI Security Conference 2024](https://docbox.etsi.org/Workshop/2024/10_SECURITYCONFERENCE/14OCTOBER/D11_FRIEDMAN_CISA.pdf) | Argues for community-led, voluntary SBOM data quality + explicit regulatory mapping (PCI DSS, EU CRA) — direct backing for Evidentia's SBOM-aware collectors and OSCAL-tagged evidence |
| 2 | **Dr. Michaela Iorga (NIST), via CSWP 53** | [Charting the Course for NIST OSCAL (Dec 2025 IPD)](https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2025/draft-charting-the-course-for-nist-oscal) | NIST commits OSCAL to "modernize manual, paper-based cybersecurity compliance through automated, scalable processes and continuous assessments" — anchors "OSCAL-native" claims to a NIST-attributed sentence |
| 3 | **Cyentia Institute (Jay Jacobs, Wade Baker), 2025 IRIS** | [Information Risk Insights Study 2025](https://www.cyentia.com/press-release-information-risk-insights-study-2025/) | "Cybersecurity incidents have surged 650% since 2008; median loss has risen from $190K to ~$3M; tail losses 5x" — quantitative justification that legacy spreadsheet GRC is economically untenable |
| 4 | **Phil Venables, Google Cloud strategic security advisor** | ["CISO 2.0" Nov 2025](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/cloud-ciso-perspectives-phil-venables-on-ciso-2-0-and-the-ciso-factory) | Argues modern CISO is "absolutely, undeniably becoming a peer business executive" needing strategy not "a long-term plan with the word strategy on the front" — reinforces Evidentia's pitch that GRC tooling has to be a strategic enabler |
| 5 | **Walter Haydock, StackAware founder** | "15 AI governance practices that built trust, managed risk, and accelerated sales" — [stackaware.com](https://stackaware.com) | Argues AI governance must be modular + adaptable because "regulation will change" — direct support for Evidentia's plugin-based collectors + adaptable control catalogs vs monolithic vendor SaaS |

All 5 satisfy: published in the last 18 months; cited by NIST/CISA/Forrester/peer-reviewed venue; compatible posture (none are anti-OSS); arguments map onto Evidentia's positioning.

### 12.3 Top 5 voices to pitch (refreshed)

All 5: shipped content in last 90 days (verified Feb-Apr 2026 activity); cover OSS GRC / supply-chain / DevSecOps adjacent topics; have track record covering smaller / earlier-stage projects; reachable through public channels.

**Notes on candidates deliberately excluded** (per Stream 6 verification): Jen Easterly (recent vehicles podcasts/speeches not peer-reviewed/Gartner-cited); Ross Anderson (deceased March 2024 per The Register obituary — correctly skipped); Bob Lord (transitioned CISA → Institute for Security and Technology; vulnerability-disclosure focus, not GRC); Andy Greenberg / Lily Hay Newman / Kim Zetter / Sean Gallagher / Patrick Gray / Allan Liska (last-90-day output skews threat/incident-investigative rather than GRC tooling); Dan Lorenc (Chainguard CEO — competitor-adjacent; better as follow target).

### 12.5 Two outreach actions that reach the whole community in one quarter

1. **Submit Evidentia to OSCAL Plugfest 2026** + ensure conformance with the OSCAL test suite. One weekend of work; gets cited in the next OSCAL Foundation update.
2. **Open an issue or discussion on github.com/oscal-compass/community** introducing Evidentia and proposing interop scenarios with compliance-trestle. That single GitHub thread surfaces Evidentia to the right ~50 humans.

### 12.6 Best 2026 conference for Evidentia

**fwd:cloudsec** (AJ Yawn keynoted "Introducing GRC Engineering" at fwd:cloudsec 2025 — direct ideological match). Also strong: FedRAMP Summit, NIST OSCAL Mini-Workshops (monthly), CSA Compliance Automation Revolution events.

## 13. The 12-month direction

> **Section summary.** The roadmap that compounds Evidentia's
> advantages: ship a determinism harness (no commercial vendor has
> this), publish the bundled multi-framework crosswalk dataset as a
> standalone artifact, add canonical scanner-JSON-to-OSCAL mappers,
> ship an MCP server, pursue OSCAL Foundation membership, harden
> supply-chain story to SLSA L3, then begin a v0.8.x AI-evidence-
> validation cycle. None of this requires raising capital; all of it
> compounds the seven existing differentiators.

### 13.1 v0.7.x — supply-chain hardening + collector + integration breadth (status May 2026)

**Status check at v0.7.8 ship time (vs. v0.7.0 plan):**
- ✓ Tightened LiteLLM pin (v0.7.0)
- ✓ SLSA L3 build provenance via `actions/attest-build-provenance@v2.4.0` (v0.7.3)
- ✓ OpenSSF Scorecard weekly run live (v0.7.2)
- ✓ Container image publish to `ghcr.io/allenfbyrd/evidentia` with cosign keyless OIDC (v0.7.5)
- ✓ 5 SQL DB collectors (v0.7.7)
- ✓ Okta + ServiceNow integrations (v0.7.7)
- ✓ Databricks + Snowflake collectors (v0.7.8)
- ✓ Tableau + Power BI publish integrations (v0.7.8)
- ⏳ OSCAL Plugfest 2026 submission (queued)
- ⏳ `oscal-compass/community` interop discussion (queued)
- ⏳ OpenSSF Best Practices Badge filing (pre-application audit complete v0.7.5; filing pending)
- ⏳ v0.7.9 — Federal compliance overlay (TPRM module + model risk module + 7 catalogs incl. FFIEC + OCC 2011-12 / SR 11-7 + FFIEC CAT — note: needs touch-up since FFIEC CAT was sunset Aug 2025; substitute CRI Profile v2.0 + governance primitives — Three Lines of Defense, Effective Challenge, KRI/KPI/KGI, Open FAIR risk quantification, process-as-code workflows + audit chain-of-custody with WORM backends)

### 13.2 v0.8.0 — the OSS-native AI moat (3-month horizon)

- **DFAH-style determinism harness** for risk-statement generation: `evidentia eval` CLI with decision-determinism + faithfulness + replay-equivalence metrics. Cite arXiv 2601.15322. **The differentiation flagship for v0.8.**
- **Policy Reasoning Traces (PRT) mode**: `evidentia risk generate --emit-trace` produces an explicit chain-of-thought trace alongside each risk statement, citing exact policy clauses. Cite arXiv 2509.23291.
- **Evidence groundedness gate**: every risk statement must cite an extracted evidence span; Evidentia refuses to emit otherwise. Borrow Ragas + DeepEval triad scoring.
- **Sigstore-signed risk-statement artifacts**: extend existing Sigstore signing to every risk statement
- **MCP server exposing Evidentia's GRC store** to Claude / ChatGPT clients
- **Publish `evidentia-catalogs` as standalone repo** under Apache-2.0 / CC0 — becomes the *de facto* multi-framework reference dataset
- **Publish risk-statement benchmark dataset on Hugging Face** — 200 manually-validated triples; becomes the evaluation standard

### 13.3 v0.9.x — collector + integration breadth (6-month horizon, refreshed)

- ✓ Okta collector (shipped v0.7.7)
- ⏳ **Azure collector** — Policy compliance state, Defender for Cloud, Entra ID. Note: `[azure]` extra is declared in pyproject.toml without backing implementation as of v0.7.8 — F-V08-1 finding; v0.7.9 batch fix
- ⏳ **GCP collector** — Security Command Center, Org Policy. Same status as Azure; same F-V08-1 finding
- ✓ ServiceNow integration (shipped v0.7.7)
- ⏳ **Vanta + Drata + Vanta-MCP / Drata-MCP integrations** — push test results to their public APIs + consume their MCP servers (positions Evidentia as "the OSS evidence layer that feeds your existing GRC SaaS")
- ⏳ **Scanner-to-OSCAL adapters**: canonical Prowler-to-OSCAL, Checkov-to-OSCAL, Trivy-to-OSCAL mappers. Slot into the OSCAL Compass + complytime ecosystems. **MITRE/saf** does the heterogeneous-scan-to-OHDF version — Evidentia could absorb the pattern.

### 13.4 v1.0 — production-ready (12-month horizon)

- 5 named reference customers (consultancies, FedRAMP CSPs, defense contractors)
- Formalized auditor partnerships (or at least a documented `evidentia oscal export --bundle-for-auditor` workflow)
- WebUI v2 with the v0.8 AI features surfaced
- SECURITY.md kept current; monthly release cadence
- Optional commercial sponsor entity for analyst inclusion (Forrester/Gartner) and SOC 2 attestation

### 13.5 Opportunistic / research-grade contributions

- **Workshop paper**: formalizing OSCAL profile-resolution semantics (target: SecDev or NIST OSCAL workshop). Empty academic territory.
- **Empirical study**: measuring real-world OSCAL adoption efficiency gains (FedRAMP 20x case studies). Empty academic territory.
- **TEE-attested evidence collectors**: run AWS/GCP collectors inside Nitro Enclave / SEV-SNP VM and embed the attestation in the OSCAL Assessment Result. Open research problem.

## 14. Risk register

> **Section summary (refreshed v0.7.8).** Ten identified risks. Two
> NEW since v0.7.0: (9) AGPL OSS competitor velocity (CISO Assistant
> + Comp AI well-capitalized + active dev); (10) license-shift risk
> across the OSS-VC-funded landscape (HashiCorp BSL / Elastic SSPL
> precedent). Risk #3 (AI hallucination) elevated to "very high"
> probability given the March 2026 Delve scandal as cautionary
> baseline. Each risk has a planned mitigation.

| # | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Vanta/Drata/Optro buy or replicate the OSCAL+OSS positioning** | Medium-High (was Medium; **Vanta added OSCAL export Feb 2026** is the canary) | High | Ship the DFAH determinism harness + PRT + Sigstore-attested AI provenance + bundled-catalogs dataset *before* they do; cryptographic evidence chain is structurally hard for SaaS to replicate without rearchitecture |
| 2 | **RegScale (or another commercial OSCAL vendor) ships a closer competitor** | Medium | Medium | RegScale is moving partly OSS via OSCAL Hub donation; collaboration > confrontation; Evidentia's library-first shape is structurally different |
| 3 | **AI hallucination incident in Evidentia's risk-statement output** | **High** (was Medium; **Delve scandal March 2026** validated the failure mode at scale: 493/494 SOC 2 reports byte-identical) | Very high | Ship DFAH-style determinism harness in v0.8 (highest priority post-v0.7.8); cite Magesh/Ho 2025 + Delve scandal in the threat model; emit groundedness-gate refusals rather than confident hallucinations; surface PCAOB AS 1105 5/5 alignment as proactive defense |
| 4 | **OSCAL adoption stalls** (e.g., FedRAMP 20x slows; CMMC delayed again) | Low-Medium | Medium | Diversify positioning across multiple tailwinds — **4 forcing functions in Q4 2026** now (CMMC + CRA + FedRAMP OSCAL + MODPA); each can stand alone |
| 5 | **Catalog maintenance burden** as 19 US states + 27 EU states + India + China + Australia + UK each evolve | High | Medium | Tier-D statutory framework community contribution channel; partner with OSCAL Foundation for catalog-maintenance shared infra; **the v0.8.0 P2.2 `evidentia-catalogs` standalone repo split** distributes the burden |
| 6 | **Single-maintainer bus factor** (Allen Byrd as solo maintainer) | High | High | Document everything in `docs/`; prefer in-repo docs over private notes (the pattern is now codified in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`); cultivate 2-3 external committers in the first 6 months |
| 7 | **Supply-chain attack on Evidentia's deps** (LiteLLM March 2026 was the canonical; **xz-Utils backdoor + ongoing social-engineering attacks against OSS maintainers per Linux Foundation April 2026** is the broader class) | Medium-High | Very high | Pin minor versions in pyproject.toml + commit `uv.lock`; subscribe to PyPI advisory feeds; Sigstore-verify all dep updates; pre-commit hooks (v0.7.3) run ruff + mypy; threat-model doc (`docs/threat-model.md`) refreshed within 180 days per pre-release-review v4 G5 gate |
| 8 | **Premature "enterprise-grade" claim** that doesn't survive a real audit | Low | High | Acknowledge the 10 honest gaps publicly; classify each as won't-fix / planned / in-progress; honest framing builds credibility, oversold framing destroys it; cite Delve scandal as cautionary baseline |
| 9 | **NEW: AGPL OSS competitor velocity** (CISO Assistant 4,008 stars + daily commits + commercial PRO; Comp AI $20M Series A Khosla Feb 2026 + AGPL + 1,535 stars + daily commits) | High | Medium-High | Apache 2.0 + Sigstore + SLSA L3 + bundled multi-framework catalogs + cryptographic evidence chain is the differentiable moat; Evidentia must ship v0.8.0 differentiators (DFAH + PRT + MCP + plugin contracts) before AGPL incumbents do |
| 10 | **NEW: License-shift risk across VC-backed OSS-adjacent platforms** (HashiCorp BSL Aug 2023 + Elastic SSPL 2021 precedent; CISO Assistant + Comp AI both AGPL+commercial — either could flip restrictively) | Medium (no major OSS GRC project flipped 2024-2026 but playbook well-established) | Medium | Apache 2.0 commitment is itself a competitive moat; surface it explicitly in positioning copy ("OSS = no acquisition risk + no license-shift risk; the code outlives any company") |
| 11 | **NEW: Forrester Wave / Gartner Magic Quadrant exclusion** | High (OSS projects don't typically get inclusion without commercial sponsor) | Medium | Realistic only after a commercial sponsor entity exists; document differentiated positioning in independent venues (NIST CSWP collaboration; JOSS submission for academic citation; OSCAL Foundation membership; OpenSSF Best Practices Badge) |

## 16. Version history

| Date | Release | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-25 | v0.7.0 (initial compile) | Compiled from 7 parallel research streams as Step 2 of the v0.7.0 comprehensive pre-tag review. |
| 2026-04-27 | v0.7.2 (skip-by-reuse) | Reviewed for v0.7.2 release on 2026-04-27; no material change since v0.7.0. Skip criteria all pass: doc < 90 days old, patch release, no new enterprise-grade claim, no category-defining competitor feature in interim, no tailwind dates passed unobserved (DORA Q1 2026 enforcement noted as past-tense in §3 buyer-personas list — minor MEDIUM bundled into v0.7.2 Step 5.A fix). Per the [release-checklist](release-checklist.md) §"Step 11 — Quarterly cadence", next full re-sync target: 2026-Q3 (~July 2026). |
| 2026-04-29 | v0.7.3 (skip-by-reuse) | Reviewed for v0.7.3 release on 2026-04-29; no material change since v0.7.0. All 5 skip criteria hold: doc 4 days old (still under 90), v0.7.3 is a patch bump, SLSA L3 build provenance was already announced in v0.7.0's `enterprise-grade.md` H2 as planned for v0.7.x (delivering on an existing claim, not introducing a new one), no competitor has shipped a category-defining feature in the 3 weeks since v0.7.0, industry-tailwind dates (DORA Q1 2026 / EU AI Act / OMB M-24-15) status unchanged. Next full re-sync target: 2026-Q3 (~July 2026), tracked as DOC5 in `docs/v0.7.3-plan.md` (deferred to v0.7.4+). |
| 2026-04-29 | v0.7.4 (skip-by-reuse) | Reviewed for v0.7.4 same-day Dockerfile-invocation hot-fix; no material change. Skip trivially holds — surface is 5 corrective `evidentia --version` → `evidentia version` invocations + version bumps + CHANGELOG/ROADMAP refresh. Zero new positioning surface. Q3 2026 quarterly cadence target unchanged (now tracked as R1 in `docs/v0.7.5-plan.md` — renumbered from v0.7.4-plan at hot-fix ship time). |
| 2026-05-01 | v0.7.5 (skip-by-reuse) | Reviewed for v0.7.5 ship; no material change. Skip holds — v0.7.5 is patch + container publish (delivering on existing enterprise-grade L1 claim, not introducing a new one) + S1-S6 security-debt batch (closing pre-existing alerts; no new positioning surface). 22 of 27 expected code-scanning alerts auto-closed; ghcr.io image cosign-signed + SLSA L3 attested. Q3 2026 quarterly cadence target unchanged. |
| 2026-05-01 | v0.7.6 (skip-by-reuse) | Reviewed for v0.7.6 ship; no material change since v0.7.0 (5 patch releases, 2 days old at last edit). All 5 skip criteria hold: doc < 90 days, v0.7.6 is patch bump, no new enterprise-grade claim (UI alpha.2 wiring delivers on an existing v0.4.0+ claim; benchmark numbers + quickstart + accepted-findings are operational hardening, not positioning surface), no competitor category-defining feature in the 3 days since v0.7.5, industry-tailwind dates unchanged. v0.7.6 P1 R1 is the explicit Q3 quarterly resync target (~July 2026), planned to land in v0.7.6 if Q3 cadence has arrived by ship time, otherwise slips to v0.7.7. |
| 2026-05-02 | v0.7.7 (skip-by-reuse) | Reviewed for v0.7.7 ship; no material change since v0.7.0 (6 patch releases). All 6 skip criteria hold: doc < 90 days (refreshed 2026-05-01), v0.7.7 is patch bump, no new enterprise-grade claim (5 SQL adapters + Okta + ServiceNow are new collector surface that extends the existing AC/AU/SC/IA evidence-collection differentiator already covered in §3.4 — they do not declare a new positioning claim), no competitor category-defining feature in the <24 hours since v0.7.6, industry-tailwind dates unchanged, threat-model doc refreshed 2026-04-30 (within 180-day gate per G5). The SQL-family is the first substantive new-collector release since v0.5.0 — strengthens an existing differentiator rather than introducing one. R1 Q3 quarterly resync still targeted ~July 2026; deferred from v0.7.6 + v0.7.7 since current date is pre-cadence. |
| 2026-05-02/03 | v0.7.8 (**FULL RE-RUN**) | First full re-run since v0.7.0. Reviewed for v0.7.8 ship as Step 2 of the v4 pre-release-review skill (variant: pre-tag full 7-step; scope Q1.4: full re-read of all 138 source files; bug-fix policy: defaults + CRITICAL inline). Allen elected the highest-thoroughness option to land the deferred R1 quarterly resync alongside the v0.7.8 ship rather than wait for July 2026 Q3 cadence. **Three substantive market developments incorporated**: (1) **AuditBoard rebranded to Optro March 9 2026** (Hg Capital's positioning move; CEO Raul Villar Jr. effective July 1 2025; FairNow acquisition Oct 2025 for AI governance); (2) **SR 11-7 superseded by SR 26-02 + OCC Bulletin 2026-13a April 17 2026** with explicit GenAI exclusion — banks stranded; opening for Evidentia's planned v0.7.9 model-risk module; (3) **Delve scandal March 2026** (493/494 leaked SOC 2 reports byte-identical; whistleblower disclosure; FTC + DOJ False Claims Act exposure being discussed) validates the AI-feature-commoditization thesis. **Other refreshes**: Vanta $300M ARR April 2026 (was $100M+); Comp AI $20M Series A Feb 2026 from Khosla / Keith Rabois (was $2.6M pre-seed); Drata acquired SafeBase $250M Feb 2026; Diligent acquired 3rdRisk Jan 2026; OneTrust active PE talks Nov 2025; Wiz → Google $32B closed March 2026; Eramba effectively exited OSS (application closed-source); 4 (was 3) regulatory forcing functions for Q4 2026 with EU CRA reporting added; PCAOB AS 1105 5/5 capability alignment surfaced as new differentiator (#8); 8 (was 6) unclaimed gaps with HF eval + Sigstore-attested AI provenance + SR-11-7-replacement-framework added; MCP first-mover window status updated (CLOSED for OSCAL primitives — IBM trestle-MCP / AWS Labs / Vanta / Drata / Optro all live; WIDE OPEN for SR-11-7 / FFIEC / SBOM / TPRM-not-in-Vanta-silo / continuous-monitoring MCPs); HF Hub keyword searches confirm zero existing OSCAL/NIST 800-53/SOC 2 datasets — Evidentia's planned v0.8.0 P2.3 eval suite is first-in-class; voices list refreshed (Stream 6 verified-public-source affiliations replacing v0.7.0 list); 88 bundled catalogs verified by direct codebase walk (was 82 at v0.7.0; v0.7.9 plans +7 to 95). **Findings queued for batch fix**: F-V08-1 (`[azure]` + `[gcp]` extras declared without backing implementations); F-V08-2 (DFAH = "Determinism-Faithfulness Assurance" not "Decision-Faithfulness Assessment"; DSE = "Document Screenshot Embedding" not "Structure Embeddings" — both arXiv-verified); F-V08-3 (SR 11-7 → SR 26-02 update needed in v0.7.9 model-risk plan); F-V08-4 (Stream 7 internal-capability-inventory agent had documented hallucinations; capability inventory in §3 redone by direct codebase walk). Stream 1 + Stream 2 each surfaced inadvertent prompt errors in the original task (Tugboat Logic was acquired by **OneTrust** 2021 not Mastercard; Stackline is a retail/ecommerce growth platform not GRC) — both corrected inline. Per-run log: `.local/pre-release-review/runs/2026-05-03T01-48-52Z.json`. |
