# Deprecation calendar

> **Status**: NORMATIVE (v0.9.7+).
>
> **Scope**: enumerates every active deprecation on Evidentia's
> public surface (CLI flags, env vars, library entry points, REST
> URIs, model fields, EventAction values, plugin contract methods,
> MCP tool names). Operators MAY rely on a deprecated surface
> continuing to work until the target removal release.
>
> **Canonical location**: `docs/deprecation-calendar.md`.
> **Cross-references**: [api-stability.md](api-stability.md)
> (deprecation policy section), [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md)
> per-release Deprecated / Removed blocks.

## Active deprecations

| Surface | Replacement | Deprecated since | Target removal | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `evidentia conmon check --last-completed-file` (CLI flag) | `--state-file` | v0.9.6 (2026-05-18) | **v1.0.0** | Normalized to match `conmon watch`, `conmon health`, `conmon mark-completed`. DeprecationWarning emitted when used; specifying both flags exits with code 2. |
| `evidentia_core.models.finding.SecurityFinding` (library class name) | `evidentia_core.models.finding.Finding` (same class, new canonical name) | v0.10.1 (2026-05-23) | **v1.0.0** (earliest major bump) | The `SecurityFinding` name is kept as a backward-compatible alias for ≥ 1 minor cycle per the deprecation policy. Both names refer to the same class — no runtime difference, no behavior change, `isinstance(obj, SecurityFinding)` and `isinstance(obj, Finding)` both succeed. The rename aligns with OCSF's "Finding" terminology (Compliance Finding, Detection Finding). No `DeprecationWarning` is emitted in v0.10.1 to avoid spamming the ~50+ existing call sites — the alias is silent. Operators / integrators are encouraged to switch to `Finding` in new code; existing code keeps working unchanged. |

No other surfaces are currently deprecated as of v0.10.1.

## Recently removed (history)

No surfaces removed yet — this is the first deprecation calendar
revision. Future removals (each tied to a major-version bump)
will be listed here for ≥ 2 minor releases past the removal so
operators searching their CHANGELOG can find the trail.

---

## How removals are sequenced

Per the [api-stability.md](api-stability.md) deprecation policy:

1. **Announce** in release N: add `DeprecationWarning` (Python),
   `Deprecation: true` header (REST), CHANGELOG entry under
   "Deprecated". Add a row to this calendar.
2. **Maintain** through release N+1: surface continues to work
   unchanged. Warning continues to emit.
3. **Remove** in release N+2 (≥ major-bump release): drop the
   surface; CHANGELOG entry under "Removed"; move calendar row
   to "Recently removed" history.

The minimum window between announce and remove is **1 full minor
release cycle** (release N → N+1 → N+2). Practical removal
windows are typically longer to give operators time to migrate.

## Process for proposing a new deprecation

1. Open a PR adding the surface to the "Active deprecations"
   table above with the proposed target removal release.
2. Update [api-stability.md](api-stability.md) if the surface is
   declared frozen there.
3. Add the deprecation announcement in the implementing release's
   CHANGELOG under "Deprecated".
4. Wire the `DeprecationWarning` (Python) or `Deprecation: true`
   header (REST) in code.
5. Add a regression test that EXERCISES the deprecated surface
   AND asserts the warning fires (preserves the deprecation path's
   testability through the maintenance window).

## Why this calendar exists

Operators integrating Evidentia in production GRC pipelines need
predictability about when they MUST migrate code paths. Listing
every active deprecation in one canonical place — with target
removal release and replacement — closes one of the open v1.0
acceptance gates per `docs/v1.0-transition.md` ("Deprecation
calendar published for any v0.9.x → v1.0 changes").

The calendar is binding under the v0.9.7 NORMATIVE api-stability
contract: Evidentia will not remove a surface listed here earlier
than its declared target removal release. Pushing a removal later
(extending the maintenance window) is non-breaking and may happen
when operator feedback surfaces.
