## v0.8.3.1 status — G4 reverted to exact-version pinning

The Dockerfile install line reads:

```dockerfile
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --user "evidentia[gui]==0.8.3.1"
```

The structural foundation that landed across v0.7.14 + v0.8.2 +
v0.8.3 IS still in place:

- `docker/requirements.in` + `docker/requirements.txt`
  regeneration tooling (`bump_version.py --regenerate-requirements`)
- `release.yml` SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH + build-twice verification
  step (kept; provides reproducibility verification value
  independently of `--require-hashes` activation)
- F-V82-S1 platform auto-detect for non-Linux hosts

What did NOT work in v0.8.3:

- Cross-platform reproducibility of `uv build` — Windows local
  + Linux CI produce different wheel bytes even with same
  SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH. The pip-compile-driven hash generation
  was Windows-host-specific; CI's Linux build couldn't match.
- This is a uv / hatchling / Python wheel-format limitation,
  not specific to Evidentia. Other projects targeting full
  reproducibility either (a) build on a single canonical
  platform, or (b) accept post-publish regeneration of the
  hash file from PyPI's actual bytes.

## v0.8.4 G4 closure plan — Path 2 (post-PyPI regeneration)

Approach:

1. release.yml `publish-pypi` job runs unchanged (publishes
   wheels with PEP 740 attestations).
2. Wait-for-PyPI step confirms all 7 packages propagated.
3. **NEW** step: `pip-compile --generate-hashes
   --no-emit-find-links` against PyPI's just-published wheels
   → writes ephemeral `docker/requirements.txt`.
4. Container build picks up the ephemeral file. Hashes are
   sourced FROM PyPI's actual bytes, so the install always
   succeeds.
5. The repo's committed `docker/requirements.txt` is treated
   as approximate/preview state (operators can use it for
   auditing). The release-time regenerated file is what
   actually gets baked into the container.

Path 2 doesn't have Path 1's cross-platform reproducibility
issue because pip downloads from PyPI on both ends + computes
SHA256 of the SAME bytes. No build determinism required.

Risk: the regenerate-requirements step is a NEW workflow step
that itself needs first-fire validation. v0.8.4 cycle-open
plans this carefully — likely workflow_dispatch test against a
throwaway tag before tagging v0.8.4.

## Historical narrative (v0.7.13 → v0.8.3.1; preserved for context)

The `Dockerfile` at the repo root used to pin the `evidentia[gui]`
install to the exact current release version (e.g.,
`evidentia[gui]==0.7.12`), **not** a full hash-pinned requirements
file. This was a deliberate trade-off rather than an oversight.

**Regeneration**: `scripts/bump_version.py --regenerate-requirements
--to A.B.C` updates the pin in `requirements.in` + invokes
`pip-compile`. Run inside the pinned base-image
(`python:3.14-slim@sha256:...`) so platform-specific transitives
(uvloop, etc.) resolve correctly:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/docker:/work" -w /work \
  python:3.14-slim@sha256:<base-digest> \
  sh -c "pip install -q pip-tools && pip-compile --generate-hashes \
    --output-file=requirements.txt requirements.in"
```

**Verification**: `docker build -t evidentia:test .` succeeds; the
pip install run inside the build emits the standard
`Successfully installed ...` lines for every package in the
hash-pinned set. A tampered transitive surfaces as
`THESE PACKAGES DO NOT MATCH THE HASHES FROM THE REQUIREMENTS FILE`
+ build failure.

**Scorecard impact**: PinnedDependencies score expected to move from
9/10 → 10/10 on the next scan. The recurring alert pattern
(#100/#101/#102/#103/#107/#108) does not re-fire because the
Dockerfile line no longer matches the alert pattern's regex.

## Historical narrative (v0.7.13 → v0.8.1; preserved for context)

The `Dockerfile` at the repo root used to pin the `evidentia[gui]`
install to the exact current release version (e.g.
`evidentia[gui]==0.7.12`), **not** a full hash-pinned requirements
file. This was a deliberate trade-off rather than an oversight.

## Why exact-version, not hash-pinning

OpenSSF Scorecard's
[`Pinned-Dependencies`](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#pinned-dependencies)
check rates `pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt` (with
hashes for every transitive dep) as the "fully pinned" target. It
flags exact-version-only installs as partially pinned (score 9/10 in
practice on this repo).

For Evidentia today the trade-off lands on exact-version because:

1. **PEP 740 attestations cover the integrity story.** Every wheel
   pushed to PyPI from this repo carries a Sigstore-signed PEP 740
   publish attestation. The release-pipeline OIDC binding
   (`allenfbyrd/evidentia/release.yml@refs/tags/v*`) is verifiable via
   `pypi-attestations verify pypi`. A compromised mirror cannot serve
   a tampered `evidentia==0.7.12` wheel without the verification
   failing.
2. **Transitive-hash maintenance burden.** A hash-pinned
   `requirements.txt` covering the full transitive closure (~140
   packages at v0.7.12) needs regeneration on every dependency bump
   from any of the 6 inter-package wheels — multiple times per
   release cycle. Without tooling that regenerates atomically with
   `bump_version.py`, the file rots within days.
3. **Container image already carries an end-to-end signature.** The
   image is cosign-signed (keyless OIDC) at
   `ghcr.io/allenfbyrd/evidentia:vX.Y.Z` and carries a SLSA L3 build
   provenance attestation against its `sha256:` digest. Operators
   verifying the image digest are already confirming that the
   `pip install` produced the expected bytes inside this specific
   immutable image.

## Roadmap to full hash-pinning (v0.8.0+)

The v0.8.0 plan reserves G4 (reproducible-build verification — build
twice + `sha256sum dist/*` match). The complementary supply-chain
work that lands alongside is full hash-pinning of the Dockerfile
install:

1. Add a generated `docker/requirements.txt` to the repo, produced by
   `pip-compile --generate-hashes` against `evidentia[gui]==X.Y.Z`
   resolved against the pinned base-image's Python.
2. Wire `scripts/bump_version.py` to regenerate the file atomically
   on every release that touches inter-package pins or the Dockerfile.
3. Switch the Dockerfile `RUN pip install` to
   `pip install --require-hashes -r /tmp/requirements.txt`.
4. Verify Scorecard's `Pinned-Dependencies` score moves from 9/10 to
   10/10 + the Code Scanning alert auto-closes.

This change is non-trivial because of the multi-package workspace —
each release touches 6 wheels and their transitive trees. Folding it
into G4's reproducible-build work keeps the verification scope
coherent.

### v0.7.14 P1.5 preview state (2026-05-05)

Steps 1 + 2 above LANDED in v0.7.14:

- **`docker/requirements.txt`** is generated via
  `pip-compile --generate-hashes` against `evidentia[gui]==0.7.13`
  (and bumped on each release via `bump_version.py
  --regenerate-requirements`). 80 packages × 2-N SHA256 hashes per
  package (~2200 lines). Inspectable for operators planning their
  own hash-pinned image builds.
- **`scripts/bump_version.py`** has a new `--regenerate-requirements`
  flag that calls `pip-compile` after the version-bump
  substitutions. Default OFF so routine bumps don't re-resolve
  the transitive closure unless explicitly requested.

Steps 3 + 4 stay deferred to v0.8.0 G4. The v0.7.14 Dockerfile
`RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --user "evidentia[gui]==X.Y.Z"`
line is unchanged. Operators wanting to validate the hash-pin
locally can run:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/docker/requirements.txt:/tmp/req.txt" \
  python:3.14-slim \
  pip install --require-hashes -r /tmp/req.txt --dry-run
```

If the dry-run succeeds, the official Dockerfile switch in v0.8.0
G4 will work.

**Why preview vs. ship**: switching the production Dockerfile install
to `--require-hashes` requires that the file format be validated
across all 6 cloud-WORM extras + the [gui] extra + future v0.8.0
extras. v0.7.14 ships the [gui]-only file as the canonical test
case; v0.8.0 G4 validates the full extras matrix + flips the
Dockerfile install line.

## What to do when the alert re-fires

Each release that bumps the Dockerfile line (`==0.7.12` →
`==0.7.13`) creates a new SARIF location fingerprint on the next
Scorecard scan. The dismissal of the prior alert ID does not carry
forward to the new ID; a fresh alert is created.

Per-release closeout (during `/pre-release-review` Step 7
post-tag verification):

1. Confirm only the recurring Dockerfile alert is open, not a new
   real finding. Run:
   ```
   gh api repos/allenfbyrd/evidentia/code-scanning/alerts \
     -q '[.[] | select(.state=="open")] | .[] | {number, file: .most_recent_instance.location.path, line: .most_recent_instance.location.start_line, rule: .rule.id}'
   ```
   Expected: one entry pointing at `Dockerfile` line 62 with rule
   `PinnedDependenciesID`.
2. Surface the dismissal command to Allen for explicit per-action
   approval (publishing-authority gated). Sample command:
   ```
   gh api -X PATCH repos/allenfbyrd/evidentia/code-scanning/alerts/<N> \
     -F state=dismissed \
     -F dismissed_reason="won't fix" \
     -F dismissed_comment="Recurring Scorecard PinnedDependencies false-positive on Dockerfile pip install. See docs/dockerfile-pinning.md. Full hash-pinning deferred to v0.8.0+."
   ```
3. After dismissal, verify CodeQL alert count returns to 0 open.
