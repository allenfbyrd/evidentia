# Dockerfile dependency pinning policy

> Status: v0.7.13 baseline. Hash-pinning roadmap: v0.8.0+ paired with
> reproducible-build verification (v0.8.0 plan G4).

## Policy

The `Dockerfile` at the repo root pins the `evidentia[gui]` install to
the exact current release version (e.g. `evidentia[gui]==0.7.12`),
**not** a full hash-pinned requirements file. This is a deliberate
trade-off rather than an oversight.

## Why exact-version, not hash-pinning

OpenSSF Scorecard's
[`Pinned-Dependencies`](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#pinned-dependencies)
check rates `pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt` (with
hashes for every transitive dep) as the "fully pinned" target. It
flags exact-version-only installs as partially pinned (score 9/10 in
practice on this repo).

For Evidentia today the trade-off lands on exact-version because:

1. **PEP 740 attestations cover the integrity story.** Every wheel
   pushed to PyPI from this repo carries a Sigstore-signed PEP 740
   publish attestation. The release-pipeline OIDC binding
   (`allenfbyrd/evidentia/release.yml@refs/tags/v*`) is verifiable via
   `pypi-attestations verify pypi`. A compromised mirror cannot serve
   a tampered `evidentia==0.7.12` wheel without the verification
   failing.
2. **Transitive-hash maintenance burden.** A hash-pinned
   `requirements.txt` covering the full transitive closure (~140
   packages at v0.7.12) needs regeneration on every dependency bump
   from any of the 6 inter-package wheels — multiple times per
   release cycle. Without tooling that regenerates atomically with
   `bump_version.py`, the file rots within days.
3. **Container image already carries an end-to-end signature.** The
   image is cosign-signed (keyless OIDC) at
   `ghcr.io/allenfbyrd/evidentia:vX.Y.Z` and carries a SLSA L3 build
   provenance attestation against its `sha256:` digest. Operators
   verifying the image digest are already confirming that the
   `pip install` produced the expected bytes inside this specific
   immutable image.

## Roadmap to full hash-pinning (v0.8.0+)

The v0.8.0 plan reserves G4 (reproducible-build verification — build
twice + `sha256sum dist/*` match). The complementary supply-chain
work that lands alongside is full hash-pinning of the Dockerfile
install:

1. Add a generated `docker/requirements.txt` to the repo, produced by
   `pip-compile --generate-hashes` against `evidentia[gui]==X.Y.Z`
   resolved against the pinned base-image's Python.
2. Wire `scripts/bump_version.py` to regenerate the file atomically
   on every release that touches inter-package pins or the Dockerfile.
3. Switch the Dockerfile `RUN pip install` to
   `pip install --require-hashes -r /tmp/requirements.txt`.
4. Verify Scorecard's `Pinned-Dependencies` score moves from 9/10 to
   10/10 + the Code Scanning alert auto-closes.

This change is non-trivial because of the multi-package workspace —
each release touches 6 wheels and their transitive trees. Folding it
into G4's reproducible-build work keeps the verification scope
coherent.

## What to do when the alert re-fires

Each release that bumps the Dockerfile line (`==0.7.12` →
`==0.7.13`) creates a new SARIF location fingerprint on the next
Scorecard scan. The dismissal of the prior alert ID does not carry
forward to the new ID; a fresh alert is created.

Per-release closeout (during `/pre-release-review` Step 7
post-tag verification):

1. Confirm only the recurring Dockerfile alert is open, not a new
   real finding. Run:
   ```
   gh api repos/allenfbyrd/evidentia/code-scanning/alerts \
     -q '[.[] | select(.state=="open")] | .[] | {number, file: .most_recent_instance.location.path, line: .most_recent_instance.location.start_line, rule: .rule.id}'
   ```
   Expected: one entry pointing at `Dockerfile` line 62 with rule
   `PinnedDependenciesID`.
2. Surface the dismissal command to Allen for explicit per-action
   approval (publishing-authority gated). Sample command:
   ```
   gh api -X PATCH repos/allenfbyrd/evidentia/code-scanning/alerts/<N> \
     -F state=dismissed \
     -F dismissed_reason="won't fix" \
     -F dismissed_comment="Recurring Scorecard PinnedDependencies false-positive on Dockerfile pip install. See docs/dockerfile-pinning.md. Full hash-pinning deferred to v0.8.0+."
   ```
3. After dismissal, verify CodeQL alert count returns to 0 open.
