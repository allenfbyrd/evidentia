# Evidentia release checklist

> Step-6 deliverable from the v0.7.0 comprehensive pre-tag review
> (compiled 2026-04-25). Comprehensive per-release update list to
> ensure future consistency and uniformity in accordance with best
> GRC and DevSecOps practice. Run this checklist for every release —
> patch, minor, or major.
>
> **This checklist is self-referential** — Step 0 below is "review
> and update this checklist itself" so it stays current as the
> project evolves.
>
> Cross-link to: [testing-playbook.md](testing-playbook.md) (the
> operational test loop), [enterprise-grade.md](enterprise-grade.md)
> (the quality bar), [capability-matrix.md](capability-matrix.md)
> (last release's test snapshot), [v0.7.2-plan.md](v0.7.2-plan.md)
> (the next release's scope), [v0.7.1-plan.md](v0.7.1-plan.md)
> (the prior release's scope, SHIPPED 2026-04-26).

## Step 0 — Review this checklist

Before doing anything else: **scan this document end-to-end** and
update any item that is now stale (new package added, new doc
created, new workflow added, etc.). A stale checklist gives you
false confidence; an honest checklist catches real bugs.

If the project has changed materially since the last release (new
package, new collector, new top-level config, new workflow), add
the corresponding new checklist items here.

---

## Step 1 — Pre-release scope confirmation

Before writing any code for a release:

- [ ] Read `docs/<X.Y.Z>-plan.md` (or `docs/ROADMAP.md` if no plan
      doc exists for this release). Confirm scope is locked.
- [ ] Verify any required design decisions for this release are
      decided (e.g., v0.7.1 had 4 design decisions D1-D4).
- [ ] Confirm any deferred items from the prior release's
      `capability-matrix.md` HIGH bucket are scheduled or explicitly
      re-deferred.
- [ ] Open a release tracking issue on GitHub describing scope.

---

## Step 2 — Version bumps + dependency pins

For every release (patch / minor / major):

- [ ] Bump `version = "X.Y.Z"` in **all 7** pyproject.toml files:
  - `pyproject.toml` (workspace root)
  - `packages/evidentia/pyproject.toml`
  - `packages/evidentia-core/pyproject.toml`
  - `packages/evidentia-ai/pyproject.toml`
  - `packages/evidentia-collectors/pyproject.toml`
  - `packages/evidentia-integrations/pyproject.toml`
  - `packages/evidentia-api/pyproject.toml`
- [ ] Bump `"version": "X.Y.Z"` in `packages/evidentia-ui/package.json`.
- [ ] **Bump inter-package dep pins** atomically. Pattern:
      `>=PREV.0,<X.0` → `>=X.0,<NEXT.0` across:
  - `packages/evidentia/pyproject.toml` (5 pins: evidentia-core,
    -ai, -collectors, -integrations, -api in `[gui]` extra)
  - `packages/evidentia-api/pyproject.toml` (2 pins: -core, -ai)
  - `packages/evidentia-ai/pyproject.toml` (1 pin: -core)
  - `packages/evidentia-collectors/pyproject.toml` (1 pin: -core)
  - `packages/evidentia-integrations/pyproject.toml` (1 pin: -core)
- [ ] **Why this matters**: Step 3 of the v0.7.0 review caught a real
      bug where `version = "..."` was bumped but inter-package pins
      were not, producing a within-release version mismatch for raw
      pip users (commit `25ccca8`).
- [ ] Run `uv sync --all-extras --all-packages` to regenerate `uv.lock`.
- [ ] Verify with `git diff packages/*/pyproject.toml` that 9 pin
      lines changed (not just 7 version lines).

---

## Step 3 — CHANGELOG

- [ ] Rename `## [Unreleased]` → `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`.
- [ ] Add a fresh `## [Unreleased]` block above with
      `_No changes yet on the vX.Y.Z+1 development branch._`.
- [ ] Write a 2-3 paragraph release-summary block at the top of the
      new entry. Include test count (`uv run pytest -q | tail -1`),
      headline features, and a cross-link to any deliverable docs
      from a pre-tag review (e.g., positioning-and-value.md,
      capability-matrix.md, vX.Y.Z+1-plan.md).
- [ ] Add a "Deferred to vX.Y.Z+1" section if applicable, with
      design rationale.
- [ ] Verify CHANGELOG renders cleanly in Markdown preview.

---

## Step 4 — Documentation refresh

- [ ] Update `docs/ROADMAP.md`:
  - Mark this release as SHIPPED with a 1-paragraph summary.
  - Add a "vX.Y.Z+1 — NEXT" section pointing at
    `docs/<next-version>-plan.md`.
  - Update the `**Last updated:**` line in the header.
- [ ] Update `docs/enterprise-grade.md` if any BLOCKER / HIGH /
      MEDIUM / LOW items moved status. Refresh the BLOCKER score.
- [ ] Verify `README.md` "Current status" section reflects the new
      version. Update version-callout banners.
- [ ] If a `docs/positioning-and-value.md` re-sync is due (quarterly
      cadence — see [`MEMORY.md` pointer](pointer_evidentia_positioning_and_value.md)):
  - Re-run the 7 research streams per the recipe in MEMORY.md
  - Snapshot the prior version as `docs/positioning-and-value-YYYY-Q[N].md`
  - Promote new synthesis to canonical `docs/positioning-and-value.md`
  - Update the version-history table in the doc
- [ ] Update `docs/log-schema.md` if any new `EventAction` entries
      were added in this release.
- [ ] If new CLI commands or REST endpoints were added, update the
      counts and command lists in:
  - `README.md` §3.4 (REST endpoint count) + §"Typer + Rich CLI"
  - `docs/capability-matrix.md` §Surface tier 7 / 8

---

## Step 5 — Test gate

Run from a clean worktree:

```bash
uv sync --all-extras --all-packages
uv run --no-sync ruff check
uv run --no-sync python -m mypy \
  packages/evidentia-core packages/evidentia-collectors \
  packages/evidentia-api packages/evidentia-ai \
  packages/evidentia-integrations packages/evidentia
uv run --no-sync python -m pytest -q --cov=packages
uv build --all-packages
uvx twine check dist/*
```

Acceptance:

- [ ] ruff: `All checks passed!`
- [ ] mypy: `Success: no issues found in N source files`
- [ ] pytest: ≥ 857 passed (the v0.7.0 baseline; will grow over
      time), ≤ 8 skipped, 16 benign Tier-C warnings
- [ ] `uv build --all-packages`: 6 evidentia-* wheels + sdists at the
      new version (no shim wheels)
- [ ] `uvx twine check dist/*`: every distribution PASSED

---

## Step 6 — Inconsistency scour

Per the testing-playbook 3-pass scour pattern:

```bash
# Pass 1: stale name references (must only appear in CHANGELOG /
# RENAMED.md / scripts/_create_shim_packages.py / scripts/_rename_content.py)
grep -ri "controlbridge"

# Pass 2: prior-version mentions (must only appear in CHANGELOG
# entries documenting prior versions)
grep -ri "PREV.X.Y"
grep -ri "X.Y-1.0"

# Pass 3: current-version coverage (should appear in 7 pyproject.toml
# + package.json + CHANGELOG + ROADMAP + enterprise-grade.md +
# capability-matrix.md as the current release)
grep -ri "X.Y.Z"

# Email leak audit (must return zero hits)
git log --all --format="%ae" | sort -u | grep "@allenfbyrd.com$" || echo "OK: zero non-noreply emails"
```

- [ ] Zero stale-name hits outside expected files.
- [ ] Prior-version mentions only in historical CHANGELOG entries.
- [ ] Current-version mentioned consistently across all sources.
- [ ] No real email addresses in commit history (only noreply forms).

---

## Step 7 — External repo + service review

```bash
gh repo view allenfbyrd/evidentia --json name,description,isArchived,defaultBranchRef
gh secret list --env pypi --repo allenfbyrd/evidentia
gh api repos/allenfbyrd/evidentia/environments/pypi --jq '{name, url, deployment_branch_policy}'
gh api repos/allenfbyrd/evidentia/branches/main/protection --jq '{required_status_checks, required_pull_request_reviews, enforce_admins, allow_force_pushes, allow_deletions}'
gh search commits --author-email allen@allenfbyrd.com --owner allenfbyrd  # zero hits
```

- [ ] Repo About description is current (no stale "Previously: ..." text).
- [ ] PyPI environment exists.
- [ ] PyPI Trusted Publisher entries exist for all 6 published packages
      (verify via `https://pypi.org/manage/project/<name>/settings/publishing/`).
- [ ] Zero `allen@allenfbyrd.com` commits across all owned repos.
- [ ] **Branch protection on `main` still active** (added in v0.7.2
      post-audit hardening). Required status checks include the test
      matrix + ruff + mypy + scorecard. `allow_force_pushes` and
      `allow_deletions` both `false`. If protection has been
      accidentally removed, re-apply per the rule documented in
      [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) before tagging.
- [ ] **`pypi` environment branch policy correct**: with branch
      protection in place,
      `deployment_branch_policy.custom_branch_policies` should be
      `true` and the policy should include both `main` and `v*`
      (the tag-triggered release path needs to deploy from a tag,
      not just a branch). If only `main` is allowed, tag pushes will
      block at the deployment-protection gate.
- [ ] **Dependabot review** — check the open Dependabot PR queue
      (`gh pr list --label dependencies --state open`). For the
      week-of-ship batch, either roll the PRs in (security updates +
      low-risk patch bumps) or defer them to the next release with
      a documented reason. Don't ship next to a security advisory
      that has an open auto-PR.
- [ ] **SECURITY.md vulnerability-coordination flow** — confirm
      `SECURITY.md` is current: SLA still accurate (3 business days
      initial / 10 business days triage), 90-day disclosure timeline
      still applies, supported-versions table reflects the
      single-supported-patch policy as of this release. If a CVE
      shipped between releases, ensure its handling is documented.

---

## Step 8 — Tag and push (the irreversible step)

**STOP for explicit user approval before proceeding.** Surface a
comprehensive pre-tag overview including:

- Commit list since the prior release tag
- Test results (passed / skipped / warnings)
- Build artifacts (6 wheels + 6 sdists at new version)
- Scour findings (zero stale references)
- External services state (PyPI publishers, GitHub repo)
- Known deferrals (HIGH-bucket items deferred to next release)

After explicit approval:

```bash
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z — <one-line summary>"
git push origin main          # if main has unpushed commits
git push origin vX.Y.Z         # the tag triggers release.yml
gh run watch                   # monitor the release workflow
```

If the release.yml workflow fails:

- For OIDC bootstrap issues (per-package PyPI Trusted Publisher
  registration mismatch), check the per-package
  `https://pypi.org/manage/project/<name>/settings/publishing/`
  page; correct the entry; re-trigger via re-pushing the tag (delete
  and re-push, or push a new patch tag).
- For SBOM / attestation issues, fix the workflow YAML, push the
  fix, push a new tag (don't reuse the failed tag).
- For partial publishes (some wheels published, others 403), fix
  the failing publisher then re-run; `skip-existing: true` in
  `release.yml` makes retries idempotent.

---

## Step 9 — Post-release verification

Within 30 minutes of `release.yml` reporting success:

- [ ] PyPI: each of the 6 packages shows version X.Y.Z at
      `https://pypi.org/project/<name>/`.
- [ ] PyPI per-file pages show the "Provenance" / PEP 740 attestation
      section with the GitHub Actions workflow URL + commit SHA.
- [ ] **Verify PEP 740 publish attestations (PyPI path)** — primary
      verifier for the per-file Sigstore-signed PEP 740 attestation
      that PyPA's publish action uploads alongside each wheel/sdist:
      ```bash
      uvx pypi-attestations verify pypi \
          --repository https://github.com/allenfbyrd/evidentia \
          "pypi:evidentia_core-X.Y.Z-py3-none-any.whl"
      ```
      Repeat for the other 5 wheels. Expect `OK: <wheel>`.
      `gh attestation verify` does NOT validate this — it defaults
      to the SLSA provenance v1 predicate, while PEP 740 publish
      attestations use `https://docs.pypi.org/attestations/publish/v1`.
      Use the SLSA-path verifier below for `gh attestation verify`.
- [ ] **Verify SLSA L3 build provenance (GitHub path)** — secondary
      verifier covering the build-provenance attestation that
      `actions/attest-build-provenance` stores under the repo's
      Attestations endpoint (added in v0.7.3 S3 per
      [`docs/v0.7.3-plan.md`](v0.7.3-plan.md)):
      ```bash
      gh attestation verify dist/evidentia_core-X.Y.Z-py3-none-any.whl \
          -R allenfbyrd/evidentia
      ```
      Expect `Loaded digest sha256:... ` and `OK`. The same command
      also validates the CycloneDX SBOM's attestation
      (`gh attestation verify evidentia-sbom.cdx.json -R allenfbyrd/evidentia`).
      Pre-v0.7.3 releases (v0.7.0/v0.7.1/v0.7.2) return HTTP 404
      because they emit only the PEP 740 publish predicate; only
      v0.7.3+ releases carry the SLSA build-provenance predicate
      that `gh attestation verify` looks for.
- [ ] CycloneDX SBOM attached to the GitHub Release.
- [ ] CHANGELOG entry renders correctly on GitHub.
- [ ] `pip install evidentia==X.Y.Z` from a clean venv succeeds; CLI
      commands work end-to-end. Also verify `pip install "evidentia[gui]==X.Y.Z"`
      pulls in `evidentia_api` (the `[gui]` extra; required to import
      the FastAPI surface).

---

## Step 10 — Post-release housekeeping

Within 1-3 days:

- [ ] Update MEMORY.md pointer entries for the shipped version.
- [ ] Archive any merged feature branches.
- [ ] Open GitHub issues for any known follow-ups discovered during
      the release process.
- [ ] If this is the first release after a major review, update
      `docs/capability-matrix.md` with any new bug findings + their
      resolution status.
- [ ] Outreach (per `docs/positioning-and-value.md` §12.5):
  - Tweet / Substack post / LinkedIn announcement
  - Engage 1-2 of the top-4-to-pitch voices (Mike Privette,
    AJ Yawn, Greg Elin, FedRAMP team)
  - Submit to OSCAL Plugfest if not already done
  - Open issue on `oscal-compass/community` for new interop
    scenarios if applicable
- [ ] Optional manual PyPI yank operations (e.g., yank shim wheels
      from prior versions if a contract specified yank at a future
      version — we did this for v0.5.1 controlbridge-* shims at v0.7.0).

---

## Step 11 — Quarterly cadence (independent of releases)

Run quarterly regardless of release schedule:

- [ ] Re-sync `docs/positioning-and-value.md` per the
      [`research_resync_automation_pattern.md`](pointer_research_resync_automation_pattern.md)
      MEMORY pointer. Snapshot to dated file; review diff; promote
      to canonical.
- [ ] Refresh `docs/enterprise-grade.md` if standards have evolved
      (NIST SSDF v1.X, FedRAMP RFC-NNNN, EU regulation enforcement
      timelines).
- [ ] Run `gh attestation verify` against a recent release to confirm
      the Sigstore / Rekor chain still validates.
- [ ] Verify Dependabot has been keeping `actions` and Python deps
      current. Apply security-only PRs immediately; batch other
      updates monthly.
- [ ] Check OpenSSF Scorecard score (after v0.7.1 ships the
      Scorecard workflow). Address any regressions.

---

## DevSecOps + GRC alignment

This checklist explicitly aligns with:

- **NIST SSDF v1.1** (PO.3 Implement Supporting Toolchains, PW.4 Reuse
  Existing, RV.2 Identify and Mitigate Vulnerabilities)
- **OpenSSF Scorecard** (Pinned-Dependencies, SBOM, Signed-Releases,
  Security-Policy)
- **CISA Secure by Design Pledge** (signed software, transparency)
- **PEP 740** (Index-Hosted Attestations for Python Package Index)
- **SLSA L3** (build provenance with isolated builders, target for
  v0.7.2 per `docs/v0.7.2-plan.md` item S3 — deferred from v0.7.1
  when that release narrowed to P0-only AI features hardening)

The 11 steps map to GRC release-management discipline:

| Step | GRC discipline |
|---|---|
| 0 (this checklist) | Continuous control monitoring (CCM) |
| 1 (scope) | Change management |
| 2-4 (versions/CHANGELOG/docs) | Configuration management baseline |
| 5 (test gate) | Verification & validation |
| 6 (scour) | Configuration audit |
| 7 (external review) | Third-party access management |
| 8 (tag/push) | Approved change deployment |
| 9 (verification) | Release verification |
| 10 (housekeeping) | Post-implementation review |
| 11 (quarterly) | Continuous monitoring |

---

## Future automation candidates

Items currently manual that could be scripted/automated:

- **Step 2 (version bumps)**: a generalized `_bump_version.py` script
  parameterized by current and target versions, handling all 7
  pyproject.toml + package.json + 9 inter-package pins atomically.
  See deprecation header on the existing one-shot
  `scripts/_bump_version.py`.
- **Step 6 (scour)**: a `scripts/_release_scour.sh` script running the
  three grep passes + the email-leak audit.
- **Step 7 (external review)**: a `scripts/_release_external_check.sh`
  script wrapping the gh API calls.
- **Step 11 (quarterly research re-sync)**: per
  `pointer_research_resync_automation_pattern.md`, can run as a
  CronCreate-scheduled session or a GitHub Action workflow.
