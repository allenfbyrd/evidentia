"""Schemathesis OpenAPI fuzz baseline (v0.9.5 P1.2 scaffold).

Reads the FastAPI OpenAPI schema directly from ``create_app()``
and runs Schemathesis's stateless property-based test suite
against each operation. Failures surface as Schemathesis-formatted
case reports including a curl-replay command for triage.

This test file is intentionally minimal — it's the seed of a
broader DAST suite. v0.9.5+ ship cycles can extend with
operation-specific tests (auth, rate-limit, schema-violation
edge cases) as DAST findings accumulate.

Pre-flight (one-time per environment):

  uv sync --all-packages

Invocation:

  uv run pytest tests/dast/test_openapi_fuzz.py -v

CI integration: this suite is OPT-IN. Not part of the default
``pytest tests/`` collection. Wire into a dedicated GH Actions
job (``dast.yml``) or run on-demand at pre-release-review Step 4.
