"""v0.8.2 G2: hypothesis configuration for property-based tests.

Sets up two profiles:

- ``ci`` — deterministic + tight deadline. Used in CI runs to
  keep results reproducible across machines + fail fast on slow
  examples that hint at accidental quadratic paths.
- ``dev`` — random + relaxed deadline. Used for local
  exploration; surfaces wider input space at the cost of
  reproducibility.

The ``ci`` profile is loaded by default. Set
``HYPOTHESIS_PROFILE=dev`` to switch locally:

    HYPOTHESIS_PROFILE=dev pytest tests/property/

References:

- Plan: §25.2 P2.2 / R3 (derandomize=True for CI flake-resistance).
