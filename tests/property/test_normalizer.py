"""Property-based tests for ``evidentia_core.gap_analyzer.normalizer``.

v0.8.2 G2 / §25.2 P2.2 (1): control-id normalization invariants.

The :func:`normalize_control_id` function reshapes user-provided
control identifiers into a canonical form. The hand-written tests
in ``tests/unit/`` cover specific known-shape inputs (e.g., NIST
``AC-2`` vs ``AC2``); these property tests exercise the full
input space (random Unicode strings) against three intrinsic
invariants:

1. **Idempotence** — calling normalize twice produces the same
   result as calling it once. This is the canonical-form contract
   (the function describes itself as returning a canonical form).
2. **Case-folding** — output never contains lowercase ASCII
   letters. The function explicitly documents
   ``Strip whitespace and convert to uppercase``.
3. **Prefix-stripping coverage** — for inputs that start with one
   of the documented prefixes (``NIST``, ``ISO``, ``CIS``,
   ``SOC2``, etc.), the output never re-emits the same prefix at
   the start.

    The function strips the first matched prefix from the documented

    instance — which is intentional per the source: a single

    loop with no early-break).

    Edge case: an input like ``"NIST NIST AC-2"`` will have ONE
    ``NIST `` stripped, leaving ``"NIST AC-2"`` — which still starts
    with ``NIST ``. The test must allow that case (the function
    only promises to strip ONE prefix, not all leading prefixes).

    pathological shape, but we still narrow the assertion: we only
    fail when an input starts with prefix P AND the output also
