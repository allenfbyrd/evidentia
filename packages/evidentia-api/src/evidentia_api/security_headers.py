"""Defense-in-depth security-response-headers middleware (v0.7.9 carry-over from F-V08-DAST-2).

Closes the v0.7.8 Step 5.A deferred LOW finding (CWE-693, Protection
Mechanism Failure): the SPA root response carried no
Content-Security-Policy / X-Frame-Options / X-Content-Type-Options /
Referrer-Policy / Strict-Transport-Security / Permissions-Policy
headers. The localhost-bound default (``evidentia serve --host
127.0.0.1``) made network-side clickjacking impractical, but operators
who exposed the UI to a network without TLS-terminating proxy
configuration would inherit the same defense-in-depth gap.

Activation policy (per plan §17 carry-over):

- **OFF by default** when binding to loopback (``127.0.0.1`` /
  ``localhost`` / ``::1``). Localhost dev-loop parity matters.
- **ON when binding to non-loopback** (``0.0.0.0`` or any
  external interface) — the operator has opted into network
  exposure; defense-in-depth headers should travel with that.
- **Forceable via** the ``--security-headers`` CLI flag or the
  ``EVIDENTIA_API_SECURITY_HEADERS=1`` env var (override the
  auto-detect; turn ON regardless of host).
- **Suppressible via** ``--no-security-headers`` (override; turn
  OFF regardless of host — useful when a reverse proxy already
  injects these headers and you don't want duplicates).

The header set follows the OWASP Secure Headers Project + Mozilla
Observatory defaults, tightened for Evidentia's specific surface
(no third-party scripts, no remote images, no embedded frames).
Single tweakable knob is `unsafe-inline` on script-src and
style-src — required by Vite's production-build SPA bundle and
Tailwind's atomic-CSS injection. v0.8.0 will revisit nonce-based
CSP once the SPA build pipeline supports CSP nonces natively.
