"""FastAPI dependency factory for opt-in RBAC enforcement (v0.9.5 P3.3; v0.9.8 P1.4 multi-tenant).

Operators wire RBAC at the router or per-route level via the
:func:`require_role` factory::

    from evidentia_api.rbac_dependency import require_role
    from evidentia_core.rbac import Role

    @router.post(
        "/poam/items",
        dependencies=[require_role("write")],
    )
    async def create_poam_item(...): ...

Or at the router level::

    router = APIRouter(dependencies=[require_role("read")])

Default policy (no policy file loaded) is permissive — every
identity gets admin role + every action is allowed. Operators
enabling RBAC set ``EVIDENTIA_RBAC_POLICY_FILE`` to a YAML
policy file path; the policy is loaded ONCE at app construction
time and stored on ``app.state.rbac_policy``.

The dependency reads the identity from the v0.8.1
:class:`AuthProvider`'s authentication result, which is already
captured on the request via :class:`AuthProviderMiddleware`.
When no AuthProvider is configured (anonymous mode), the
identity is None — combined with the default permissive policy,
this maintains v0.9.4 backward-compat.

v0.9.8 P1.4 — multi-tenant
--------------------------

Closes the v0.9.7 F-V97-multi-tenant-claim-spoofing INFO finding.
When ``app.state.rbac_policy`` is a :class:`TenantRBACPolicy`, the
dependency dispatches to :func:`check_permission_multi_tenant`. The
tenant claim is extracted from the principal's ``@@<tenant>`` suffix
— and only from there. Env vars + request headers are NOT honored
on the FastAPI side, so an unauthenticated client cannot assert a
tenant claim it doesn't actually hold. The principal string is set
by :class:`AuthProviderMiddleware` from the result of
:meth:`AuthProvider.authenticate`, which validates the credential
against the operator's token / mTLS / SSO config — provenance is
end-to-end from the credential to the RBAC decision.

Threat-model boundary: RBAC does NOT replace authentication.
Identity arrives from the AuthProvider; RBAC consumes it. If
the AuthProvider is not configured, every request is anonymous
+ the default policy decides what's allowed (permissive by
default; deny-by-default when operator opts in).

       This is the canonical authenticated-identity source.
    2. ``request.state.identity`` — kept for backward compat with
       any custom middleware that uses the v0.9.5 attribute name
       (documented but never populated by the upstream middleware
       — closes a latent attribute-name disconnect).
    3. ``None`` — anonymous (no AuthProvider configured OR token
       rejected at the middleware layer).

    Centralized here so the source-of-truth for "who is the
    caller?" is one function — the dependency below + future
    audit-logging hooks share the resolution.

           the single-tenant :func:`check_permission` — preserves
           v0.9.5 + v0.9.6 behavior for non-multi-tenant deployments.
