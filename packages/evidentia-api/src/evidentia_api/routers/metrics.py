"""``GET /api/metrics`` — Prometheus text-format exposition (v0.8.0 P1 G3).

Lightweight stdlib-only implementation of a Prometheus-
compatible metrics endpoint. Exposes:

- ``evidentia_app_info{version="..."}`` — single-sample gauge
  carrying the running version (label-encoded; standard
  Prometheus convention).
- ``evidentia_audit_events_total{action="..."}`` — counter
  tracking the cumulative count of audit events per
  EventAction since process start.
- ``evidentia_audit_events_failures_total`` — counter for
  audit events with EventOutcome.FAILURE.
- ``evidentia_uptime_seconds`` — gauge showing how long the
  process has been running.

The counters tap into the existing
:mod:`evidentia_core.audit` event-firing path via a lightweight
in-process counter dict. The metrics are PROCESS-LOCAL — a
multi-process deployment will need an external aggregator
(Prometheus Pushgateway, statsd, etc.). For v0.8.0 single-
process operation, this gives operators visibility into AI
call rates, retention transitions, eval runs, and any other
audit-tracked action without a heavyweight client library.

The endpoint emits ``Content-Type: text/plain; version=0.0.4;
charset=utf-8`` per the official Prometheus exposition format
spec (https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/).
Operators can scrape this with ``prometheus.io`` directly OR
ingest into Grafana Agent / OpenTelemetry Collector for
metric forwarding.

OPERATIONAL POSTURE (v0.8.0 review F-V08-S3): the endpoint is
NOT auth-gated. Acceptable for the default localhost-bound
deployment (`uvicorn --host 127.0.0.1`) where the same trust
boundary already applies to ``/api/docs`` + ``/api/health``.
For non-loopback bind (`--host 0.0.0.0`), operators MUST
front the endpoint with reverse-proxy basic auth, mTLS, or a
network-segregated scrape network — Prometheus exposition
output reveals server fingerprint + operational telemetry
that an attacker can use to time auth-spray attacks. v0.8.1
will wire :class:`AuthProvider` plugin contract into the
FastAPI dependency stack so this endpoint inherits the same
auth requirement as ``/api/risks`` and other gated routers.
