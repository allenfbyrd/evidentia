"""Gap-analysis router — run + list + diff gap reports.

Endpoints:
- ``POST /api/gap/analyze`` — run a GapAnalyzer pass and persist to gap_store
- ``GET /api/gap/reports`` — list saved reports (newest first)
- ``GET /api/gap/reports/{key}`` — load a specific saved report
- ``POST /api/gap/diff`` — compute a diff between two saved reports

Inventory input accepts either a server-side file path (typical for CLI
integration) or an inline YAML/JSON blob (typical for browser upload).
