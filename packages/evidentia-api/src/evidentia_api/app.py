"""FastAPI application factory.

The module-level ``app`` is the canonical instance that uvicorn references.
For testing (TestClient), prefer :func:`create_app` which accepts overrides.

All API routes live under ``/api/*``. Static assets (the bundled React SPA)
are mounted at ``/`` and serve ``index.html`` for every non-``/api/*`` path
to support client-side routing (React Router).

In v0.4.0 the static directory is populated at wheel-build time by the
frontend build hook in ``.github/workflows/release.yml`` (it runs
``npm run build`` in ``packages/evidentia-ui`` and copies ``dist/*``
into ``src/evidentia_api/static/``). When the directory is empty at
runtime (e.g. fresh dev install without a build), a placeholder JSON
response is returned instead of 404 so the error is self-explanatory.

Offline mode: the ``evidentia serve --offline`` CLI entry point sets
``EVIDENTIA_API_OFFLINE=1`` in the subprocess env. This module reads
that at import time to flip the process-wide air-gap guard before any
router handler runs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    offline
        When True, flips the process-wide air-gap guard at app creation.
        Every LLM/network call then refuses non-loopback targets.
    dev_mode
        When True, CORS is permissive to support the Vite dev server
        (http://127.0.0.1:5173) without a proxy.
    cors_origins
        Explicit allow-list override. Default: restrictive localhost-only.
    security_headers
        When True, attach :class:`SecurityHeadersMiddleware` so every
        response carries CSP / X-Frame-Options / X-Content-Type-Options
        / Referrer-Policy / Strict-Transport-Security / Permissions-
        Policy headers. When None (default), reads the
        ``EVIDENTIA_API_SECURITY_HEADERS`` env var (``"1"`` → on; any
        other value → off). The CLI ``evidentia serve`` flag wires the
        env var on the operator's behalf with auto-detection per
        bind-host. Closes v0.7.8 F-V08-DAST-2 LOW finding (CWE-693).
    auth_provider
        v0.8.1 P3.3: optional :class:`AuthProvider` instance from
        ``evidentia_core.plugins.auth``. When non-None, attaches
        :class:`AuthProviderMiddleware` so every ``/api/*`` route
        requires a valid bearer token (gating
        :class:`AuthResult.authenticated`). Liveness probes
        (``/api/health``, ``/api/version``) bypass auth per the
        UNAUTHENTICATED_PATHS allowlist. Default ``None`` matches
        v0.8.0 behavior (no auth gating). Closes v0.8.0 review
        F-V08-S3 ``/api/metrics`` MEDIUM finding when populated.
    trust_proxy_headers
        v0.9.5 P1.6: when True, auto-wires uvicorn's
        :class:`ProxyHeadersMiddleware` so ``X-Forwarded-For`` is
        honored when determining the client IP. Use when Evidentia
        sits behind a reverse proxy / ingress controller that
        terminates TLS and forwards the client IP via the standard
        ``X-Forwarded-*`` headers (NGINX, Traefik, Envoy, AWS ALB,
        GCP HTTPS LB, Cloudflare). When None (default), reads the
        ``EVIDENTIA_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS`` env var (``"1"`` → on; any
        other value → off). Default off MUST be honored when there
        is no proxy in front, because honoring ``X-Forwarded-For``
        in that scenario lets clients spoof their IP for rate-limit
        bypass + audit-log evasion. Closes the v0.9.4 docstring
        deferral noted in ``rate_limit.py``.

        ``forwarded_allow_ips``: trusted as ``"*"`` when enabled;
        operators wanting tighter control should configure their
        proxy to strip + re-add ``X-Forwarded-For`` so the Evidentia
        process only sees trusted values.
