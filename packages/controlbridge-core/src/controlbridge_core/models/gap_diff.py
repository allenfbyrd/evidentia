"""Gap-diff models — compare two :class:`GapAnalysisReport` snapshots.

v0.3.0 introduced these types to support `controlbridge gap diff`, the
PR-level compliance-as-code command. The diff compares two reports (the
"base" and the "head" — names chosen to match `git diff` semantics) and
classifies each `(framework, control_id)` pair as one of five states:

- **closed**: present in base, absent (or status=CLOSED) in head. Good.
- **opened**: absent in base, present in head. Regression.
- **severity_increased**: same gap appears in both, severity went up.
- **severity_decreased**: same gap appears in both, severity went down.
- **unchanged**: same gap, same severity, both reports.

The model is Pydantic-validated and JSON-serializable so CI jobs can
upload diff reports as artifacts without custom serializer code.
