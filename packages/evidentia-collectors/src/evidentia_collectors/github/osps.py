"""GitHub-collector populate helpers for the OSPS Baseline.

This module ships ~15 ``populate_osps_*`` helpers, one per automatable
OSPS Baseline control that GitHub's REST API can observe directly. Each
helper takes a :class:`GitHubClient` plus ``(owner, repo)`` and returns
a single :class:`SecurityFinding` carrying:

- ``compliance_status``: PASS / FAIL / WARNING / NOT_APPLICABLE / UNKNOWN
  per the v0.10.0 OCSF-alignment contract.
- ``control_mappings``: one :class:`ControlMapping` against
  ``framework="osps-baseline"`` plus (where natural) one or more
  cross-walk mappings against NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 control families.
- ``source_finding_id``: deterministic
  ``osps-<id>:<owner>/<repo>[:<scope>]`` pattern, which lets the
  v0.10.5 P10 :class:`SecurityFinding._derive_deterministic_id`
  validator derive a stable UUID5 ``id`` across re-runs.

Coverage as of v0.10.6 (16 controls):

- **Access Control**: ``OSPS-AC-03.01`` (default-branch protection),
  ``OSPS-AC-03.02`` (deletion guard).
- **Build & Release**: ``OSPS-BR-06.01`` (release signatures /
  attestations on release assets).
- **Documentation**: ``OSPS-DO-02.01`` (defect-reporting mechanism
  via ``has_issues``).
- **Governance**: ``OSPS-GV-03.01`` (CONTRIBUTING guide).
- **Legal**: ``OSPS-LE-02.01`` (OSI/FSF-recognized license),
  ``OSPS-LE-03.01`` (LICENSE in well-known location).
- **Quality**: ``OSPS-QA-01.01`` + ``OSPS-QA-01.02`` (public source +
  public change history), ``OSPS-QA-02.01`` (dependency manifest),
  ``OSPS-QA-03.01`` (required status checks).
- **Vulnerability Management**: ``OSPS-VM-02.01`` (SECURITY.md),
  ``OSPS-VM-03.01`` (private-vulnerability-reporting),
  ``OSPS-VM-04.01`` (security-advisories surface),
  ``OSPS-VM-05.03`` (Dependabot SCA active),
  ``OSPS-VM-06.02`` (code-scanning / SAST active).

**OSPS-VM-05 overlap with dependabot.py.** This module's
``populate_osps_vm_05_03`` emits a **posture finding** (the control
itself is in place, observable via the ``vulnerability-alerts``
endpoint). It is intentionally complementary to the existing
:class:`~evidentia_collectors.github.dependabot.DependabotCollector`,
which emits one finding per CVE alert (the underlying advisories). The
two are emitted at different granularities, both with valid
:class:`ComplianceStatus` against different OSPS bands —
``populate_osps_vm_05_03`` against OSPS-VM-05 (the control), and
``DependabotCollector`` against the per-CVE evidence chain (mapped to
SI-2 / RA-5 / SR-3 etc.). Neither subsumes the other; they are wired
side-by-side in any future composite collector.

**Error handling contract.** Helpers wrap their GitHub calls in
``try/except GitHubApiError`` blocks. A transport or 5xx failure on the
inner call returns a finding with
:class:`ComplianceStatus.UNKNOWN` — operators get a complete run with
the indeterminate items flagged, rather than an aborted run with no
evidence. Endpoint-specific 404s (e.g., branch-not-protected) are
**signal**, not errors, and the underlying ``GitHubClient`` methods
already return ``None`` / empty list in those cases. The same asymmetry
applies to the multi-path file probes (CONTRIBUTING / LICENSE /
dependency-manifest / SECURITY.md): :func:`_file_present_at_any`
distinguishes a clean all-404 (the file is genuinely **absent** → FAIL)
from an all-/any-5xx failure with no hit (we **don't know** → UNKNOWN);
the latter must not masquerade as a definitive absence.
