"""AWS IAM Access Analyzer collector (v0.7.0).

Collects evidence findings from AWS IAM Access Analyzer — findings that
directly evidence NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 access-control requirements
(AC-3, AC-4, AC-5, AC-6, AC-6(1), IA-2, IA-5, CM-3, SA-3).

Three analyzer types are supported; each requires its own analyzer
instance in AWS:

- **External access** (``TYPE_EXTERNAL_ACCESS``) — identifies
  resource-based policies that grant access to principals outside
  the analyzer's zone of trust.
- **Unused access** (``TYPE_UNUSED_ACCESS``) — identifies IAM roles,
  users, access keys, passwords, and permissions that haven't been
  used within the configured window.
- **Internal access** (``TYPE_INTERNAL_ACCESS``) — identifies
  potential access paths within the organization / account.

Authoritative mapping sources:

- AWS Audit Manager 'AWS NIST 800-53 Rev 5' framework
  (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/NIST800-53r5.html)
- AWS Security Hub NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 standard
  (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/standards-reference-nist-800-53.html)
- FedRAMP Rev 5 baseline access-control requirements

**Blind-spot disclosures** are emitted as ``back-matter.resources[]``
entries with ``class="blind-spot"`` so auditors reading the OSCAL AR
see the limits of Access Analyzer coverage inline, satisfying the
Q7=Yes checklist requirement for in-document disclosure.

Usage::

    collector = AccessAnalyzerCollector(
        analyzer_arn="arn:aws:access-analyzer:us-east-1:…:analyzer/grc",
        region="us-east-1",
    )
