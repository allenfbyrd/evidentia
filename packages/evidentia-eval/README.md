# evidentia-eval

Dev-time AI-output quality eval harness for Evidentia.

Hosts the **DFAH (Decision-Faithfulness Assessment Harness)** —
the auditor-defensible numerical proof layer that validates
LLM-driven artifact production is deterministic, replay-
equivalent, and faithful to its source policy clauses.

## Why this package exists (v0.10.5 P9 extraction)

The DFAH harness was originally bundled into `evidentia-ai` (the
risk-statement generator + control explainer package). That
conflated two very different deployment surfaces:

- **`evidentia-ai`** — PRODUCTION runtime. Needed in air-gap
  installs to actually generate risk statements.
- **`evidentia-eval`** — DEVELOPMENT-time evaluation. NOT needed
  in air-gap installs; only fires when a CI pipeline runs a
  determinism / faithfulness gate before tagging a release.

Extracting the eval harness lets air-gap installs of
`evidentia-ai` skip the optional sentence-transformers stack
entirely (it now lives behind `evidentia-eval[faithfulness-semantic]`
instead of `evidentia-ai[eval-faithfulness]`).

## Quick start

```bash
# Stdlib Jaccard baseline (no extra needed; <10 MB install)
pip install evidentia-eval

# Optional semantic-similarity faithfulness (~250 MB extra
# for sentence-transformers + numpy + model cache on first use)
pip install 'evidentia-eval[faithfulness-semantic]'
```

CLI verbs:

```bash
# Smoke test against a deterministic stub generator (no LLM
# tokens burned)
evidentia eval stub-smoke

# Real-LLM determinism gate against the risk-statement generator
evidentia eval risk-determinism --gap-report gaps.json \
    --system-context ctx.yaml \
    --fail-on-determinism-rate-below 0.95

# Verify a previously-signed eval bundle
evidentia eval verify path/to/eval-output.json
```

The CLI verbs live in `evidentia.cli.eval` (the meta-package);
this package contributes the underlying library.

## Backward-compat shim

For external scripts that still import `from evidentia_ai.eval
import ...`, `evidentia-ai` ships a deprecation shim that
re-exports from `evidentia_eval`. The shim warns once at import
time and is scheduled for removal in **v0.12.0**.
