# controlbridge-api

FastAPI REST server and bundled React web UI for **ControlBridge**, the open-source GRC tool.

This package is not typically installed directly. The preferred way is via the `[gui]` extra on the meta-package:

```bash
uv tool install "controlbridge[gui]"
# or
pip install "controlbridge[gui]"
```

Then run:

```bash
controlbridge serve
# -> FastAPI + React UI at http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

## What's inside

- **FastAPI app** (`controlbridge_api.app:app`) — REST endpoints mirroring every CLI capability.
- **SPA** — React/Vite/shadcn/ui frontend, bundled as static assets inside the wheel under `controlbridge_api/static/`.
- **SSE streaming** — long-running LLM calls (`risk generate`, `explain`) stream progress to the browser without blocking.

## REST surface

Every endpoint is typed with Pydantic models reused from `controlbridge-core`. All endpoints bind to `127.0.0.1` by default; `--host 0.0.0.0` emits a security warning.

## Air-gapped mode

Running `controlbridge serve --offline` wires the air-gap guard into every `/api/*` call. LLM features gracefully degrade with a pointer to Ollama. See [`docs/air-gapped.md`](../../docs/air-gapped.md).

## Development

```bash
# From the repo root:
uv sync --all-packages
cd packages/controlbridge-ui && npm install && npm run dev  # Vite dev server at :5173
# In another terminal:
controlbridge serve --dev  # FastAPI at :8000 proxies /api/* to itself, / to Vite :5173
```
