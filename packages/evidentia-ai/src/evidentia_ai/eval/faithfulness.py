"""DFAH faithfulness scoring (v0.8.2 §25.2 P3.1).

Second arXiv 2601.15322 metric, alongside the v0.8.0 determinism +
replay-equivalence gates. Faithfulness asks: do the claims in a
generated risk statement (or any AI-produced artifact) trace back
to the source policy clauses, or did the LLM hallucinate content
not present in the input?

Methodology (v0.8.2 stdlib baseline):

The :func:`faithfulness_score` function uses a Jaccard token-
overlap similarity over a normalized lowercase token set. For a
given claim and a list of source clauses, we compute the
similarity between the claim and each clause, then return the
maximum similarity as the faithfulness score. The top-3
clauses (by similarity) are returned as evidence so an auditor
reviewing a low-faithfulness flag can see what the LLM was
plausibly riffing on.

The Jaccard baseline is intentionally conservative — it catches
gross hallucinations (claims with zero token overlap to any
clause) but misses paraphrases. Operators wanting semantic-
similarity scoring can install the optional
``[eval-faithfulness]`` extra carrying ``sentence-transformers``;
when present, :func:`faithfulness_score_semantic` (v0.8.3 work)
will use sentence embeddings instead. For v0.8.2 we ship the
stdlib path as the floor; semantic upgrades are additive.

The result model :class:`FaithfulnessResult` is JSON-serializable
+ Sigstore-signable as part of the wider DFAH eval output.
Per-claim scores below the configurable threshold (default 0.3
for the stdlib Jaccard baseline; semantic scoring would tune
the default upward) emit
:attr:`EventAction.AI_EVAL_FAITHFULNESS_VIOLATION` for audit
visibility.
