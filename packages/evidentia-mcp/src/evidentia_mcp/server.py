"""FastMCP server build + stdio run helper (v0.8.0 P0.3).

The MCP server exposes a focused tool surface mapping
Evidentia's library functions into a shape MCP clients
(Claude Desktop, Claude Code, ChatGPT Desktop, custom
clients) can call directly.

Tool surface (v0.8.0 ship):

- ``list_frameworks`` — enumerate the 89 bundled catalogs +
  their tier / placeholder / license-required metadata.
- ``get_control`` — return the raw catalog entry (id, title,
  description) for a single control. Read-only; no LLM.
- ``gap_analyze`` — load a control inventory from disk, run
  :class:`evidentia_core.gap_analyzer.GapAnalyzer` against
  the requested frameworks, return the report as a JSON-
  serializable dict. Read-only; no LLM.
- ``gap_diff`` — load two ``GapAnalysisReport`` JSON files
  from disk, run :func:`evidentia_core.gap_diff.compute_gap_diff`,
  return the diff summary. Read-only; no LLM.

Tools that require the LLM provider env vars (LiteLLM-driven
``OPENAI_API_KEY`` / ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` / etc.) gracefully
return a structured error when the env var is absent rather
than crashing the server.

Future slices add: ``risk_generate``, ``explain_control_llm``,
``oscal_emit``, ``collect_aws`` / ``collect_github`` /
``collect_jira``. Each new tool ships with a self-contained
test fixture.

Per the Evidentia secret-handling protocol, the MCP server
NEVER accepts credentials in tool arguments — provider-specific
env vars are read at tool-call time, and the resulting auth
errors surface as structured tool errors (not raw stack
traces).
