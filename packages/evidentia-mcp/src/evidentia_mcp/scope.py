"""CIMD per-tool scope enforcement gate (v0.8.6 P1).

Wraps :meth:`mcp.server.fastmcp.FastMCP.call_tool` so every tool
dispatch routes through one authorization choke-point. The gate
is opt-in: when the server is built without a CIMDRegistry
attached, calls pass through with no audit emit (preserves
v0.8.5 behavior). When a CIMDRegistry IS attached + the gate is
wired, every call emits exactly one of two structured audit
events:

- :attr:`EventAction.AI_MCP_TOOL_AUTHORIZED` — call permitted
  (client_id is registered AND scope contains tool_name)
- :attr:`EventAction.AI_MCP_TOOL_DENIED` — call rejected;
  raised back to the MCP client as an
  :class:`mcp.shared.exceptions.McpError` with code
  ``-32602`` (Invalid Params per JSON-RPC 2.0)

Design rationale
----------------

The MCP Python SDK 1.27 does NOT expose a public
``before_tool_call`` hook or ``tool_call_middleware``
decorator. The only chokepoint that intercepts EVERY
``tools/call`` request is :meth:`FastMCP.call_tool` (defined at
``.venv/Lib/site-packages/mcp/server/fastmcp/server.py:343``).
The canonical patch pattern is to MONKEY-BIND a wrapper to the
already-instantiated server's ``call_tool`` attribute (vs
subclassing FastMCP, which would require re-declaring all
tool registrations under the subclass). Monkey-binding is the
minimum-blast-radius approach: it intercepts the same dispatch
the SDK uses internally for ``ListToolsResult`` + ``CallToolResult``,
and reverts cleanly when the server is destroyed.

Verify-during-implementation sentinel: if the ``mcp`` SDK ever
ships a public ``tool_call_middleware`` decorator (target:
1.28+), refactor this module to register through that
decorator instead. The audit-event emission semantics stay the
same; only the wrapping mechanism changes.

Per-transport client_id resolution
-----------------------------------

stdio transport
    The MCP wire protocol does NOT carry a per-request
    ``client_id`` field on stdio. Stdio is a single-client
    transport — one MCP host process talks to one server
    process via standard input + output. The
    ``--default-client-id`` flag on
    ``evidentia mcp serve`` IS THE client_id for stdio
    deployments. **This is informational, not a security
    boundary** — a malicious stdio host process could trivially
    invoke tools regardless of CIMD configuration since stdio
    transport runs as the operator's UID. CIMD on stdio is
    primarily for audit-trail granularity ("which named client
    invoked this tool"), not for AuthZ.

HTTP / SSE transports
    The MCP request meta-block CAN carry a ``client_id`` field
    set by the calling MCP client. FastMCP surfaces it via
    :attr:`Context.client_id` (the ``request_context.meta.client_id``
    accessor at line 1286). When that value is None (client
    didn't set it), the gate falls back to the
    ``--default-client-id`` flag. When BOTH are None, the gate
    DENIES — ambiguous-caller policy. Operators deploying
    non-loopback HTTP/SSE deployments MUST also wire
    transport-level authentication (reverse-proxy mTLS, bearer
    tokens) so clients cannot impersonate each other's
    ``client_id`` declarations.

The threat model
----------------

CIMD is NOT authentication. Documented prominently in
:mod:`evidentia_mcp.cimd` and re-asserted here: the gate gives
operators (1) per-client allowlist control over which tools
each client may call AND (2) a structured audit trail of every
authorize + deny decision. It does NOT prevent a transport-
unauthenticated client from claiming any client_id it wants.
Transport-level authentication is the prerequisite for using
CIMD as an AuthZ control.

Audit events
------------

Both events carry the same evidentia-extension fields:

* ``run_id`` — ULID per call (NOT correlated with the
  DFAH ``run_id`` ULID; this one is per-MCP-tool-call)
* ``client_id`` — the resolved client_id (precedence:
  ``Context.client_id`` → ``default_client_id`` → ``None``)
* ``tool_name`` — the requested tool name
* ``scope_allowlist`` — the registered scope string for
  ``client_id`` (or ``None`` if unregistered / ambiguous)

    Idempotent: calling this function twice on the same server

    Args:
        server: A FastMCP server instance, typically returned by

            CIMDRegistry; when ``None``, this function still wires
            a wrapper but the wrapper passes through with no audit
            emit (registry-absent = v0.8.5 no-gating behavior).
        default_client_id: Fallback ``client_id`` when
