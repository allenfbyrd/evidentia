"""Security finding model for collector outputs.

Collectors produce findings (raw security observations from systems).
Findings are then transformed into OSCAL Assessment Results documents
with explicit control mappings.

v0.7.0 schema upgrade:

- ``control_ids: list[str]`` is replaced by ``control_mappings:
  list[ControlMapping]`` with OLIR relationship typing + justification
  on every mapping. The old ``control_ids`` kwarg is still accepted on
  construction for backward compatibility (auto-converted via
  ``@model_validator``); a read-only ``.control_ids`` property returns
  the plain IDs for callers that only need them.
- ``collection_context: CollectionContext`` is a new field capturing
  per-finding provenance. Defaults to a synthetic-legacy context so
  pre-v0.7.0 construction sites keep working; upgraded collectors
  (v0.7.0+) pass real context.

v0.10.0 schema upgrade (OCSF alignment):

- ``compliance_status: ComplianceStatus`` records the pass/fail
  result of the checked control, mirroring the OCSF Compliance
  Finding ``compliance.status`` field. Defaults to ``UNKNOWN`` so
  pre-v0.10.0 construction sites (and collectors not yet migrated)
  keep working without asserting a result.
- ``remediation: str | None`` carries optional remediation guidance,
  mapping to the OCSF Compliance Finding ``remediation.desc`` field.

Both fields are additive and optional — v0.7.x / v0.8.x / v0.9.x
serialized findings re-parse cleanly. See ``docs/v0.10.0-plan.md``
for the OCSF mapping design.

See :mod:`evidentia_core.audit.provenance` for the CollectionContext
model and :class:`~evidentia_core.models.common.OLIRRelationship` for
the relationship vocabulary.

        Added v0.10.5 Phase 10 (idempotency hardening for the v1.0 API
        freeze). When the caller did NOT supply ``id=...`` explicitly
        AND both ``source_system`` and ``source_finding_id`` are present
        in the construction kwargs, derive ``id`` via
        :func:`~evidentia_core.models.common.deterministic_finding_id`.

        Effect: two ``collect()`` calls against an unchanged source
        produce findings whose ``id`` values are identical. The same
        OSCAL Assessment Results document re-emitted from a re-run is
        bit-stable on the identity axis (timestamps still vary).

        Backward-compat:

        - Explicit ``id=`` always wins — operators and ingest paths that
          set ``id`` directly are unaffected. This includes the OCSF
          Detection Finding ingest path that sets ``id=info.uid`` from
          third-party input.
        - When ``source_finding_id`` is None / empty, no derivation runs
          and the ``default_factory=new_id`` random UUID v4 is used.
          This preserves the behaviour of the synthetic-legacy code
          path in ``_synthetic_legacy_context`` and the migration
          helper in ``models/migrations/v0_6_legacy.py``.

        Trust boundary: this validator is identity-derivation only. It
        does NOT validate that ``source_finding_id`` is non-malicious —
        a hostile collector could deterministically derive an ID that
        collides with another collector's finding by spoofing both
        ``source_system`` and ``source_finding_id``. The UUID5 namespace
        + the NUL-byte separator make accidental collisions impossible;
        intentional collisions require lying about both natural keys,
        which is a trust-boundary issue handled upstream by the
        collector authentication + provenance pipeline (see
        ``CollectionContext.credential_identity``).

        See: ``docs/collector-idempotency-audit.md`` §4 for the full
