"""Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) models.

Introduced in v0.7.9 P0.1 per `docs/v0.7.9-plan.md`. The TPRM module
brings Evidentia into the regulated financial-services compliance
domain by providing first-class vendor-inventory, fourth-party-
disclosure, and Sigstore-signed-evidence-reference primitives.

The taxonomy aligns to two regulatory substrates:

- **FFIEC Vendor Management** (per the FFIEC IT Examination Handbook
  Outsourcing booklet): criticality-tier model + due-diligence-cadence
  expectations. Critical/high vendors receive annual review;
  medium = biennial; low = triennial. Captured via
  :meth:`Vendor.compute_next_review_due`.

- **OCC Bulletin 2013-29 + FRB SR 13-19** (Third-Party Relationships /
  Vendor Risk Management): the regulatory-classification taxonomy
  (custody, clearing, model, data_processor, critical_third_party)
  surfaces enforcement-relevant vendor flags.

A vendor's `regulatory_classification: list[Literal['model']]` flag is
the cross-link to the v0.7.9 P0.6 Model Risk Management module
(`evidentia model-risk`) — see SR 26-02 + OCC 2026-13a (April 2026
active model-risk guidance, superseding SR 11-7 + OCC 2011-12, with
explicit generative-AI/agentic-AI exclusion noted in
`docs/v0.7.9-plan.md` §1).

ID convention: UUID v4 via `new_id()` to match the rest of the model
layer (gaps, evidence, findings, risks). The v0.7.9-plan §P0.1 spec
table proposed ULID; the model-layer convention won out for
consistency. Audit-loop sequence ordering uses ULID elsewhere
(`evidentia_core.audit.logger`) where time-orderability matters; the
TPRM vendor inventory does not require time-ordered IDs since each
vendor record carries its own `created_at` + `updated_at` timestamps.
