    Two calls with identical ``(source_system, source_finding_id)``
    arguments produce byte-identical output, so re-running a collector
    against an unchanged source yields the same
    :attr:`~evidentia_core.models.finding.SecurityFinding.id` for every
    logical finding. Added v0.10.5 Phase 10; see
    :doc:`docs/collector-idempotency-audit </collector-idempotency-audit>`
    for the per-collector design rationale.

    The payload separator is a NUL byte — illegal in either argument
    (`source_system` is a short identifier like ``"aws-config"``;
    ``source_finding_id`` is constructed from natural API IDs that
    never contain NUL). This guarantees no collision between e.g.
    ``("aws", "config:bucket")`` and ``("aws-config", "bucket")``.

    Args:
        source_system: Stable collector identifier (e.g. ``"aws-config"``,
            ``"github"``, ``"okta"``). MUST be non-empty.
        source_finding_id: The collector's natural per-finding key
            (e.g. ``f"{rule_name}:{resource_id}"``, ``f"{slug}:{branch}:{rule}"``,
            a native source UID like a GitHub alert number). MUST be non-empty.

    Returns:
        The canonical-string form of a UUID v5 (e.g.
        ``"a3b2c1d0-...".``). Matches the format of :func:`new_id` for
        drop-in compatibility everywhere ``SecurityFinding.id`` is
        consumed.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if either argument is empty / whitespace-only.

    Example:
        >>> deterministic_finding_id("aws-config", "s3-public-read:bucket-one")
        '... a stable UUID v5 string ...'
