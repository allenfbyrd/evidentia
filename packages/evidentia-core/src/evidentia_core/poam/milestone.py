"""Milestone collection helpers — sort, group, time-window slicing.

Used by the v0.9.0 P2 CLI ``poam list`` + ``poam show`` verbs +
the OSCAL POA&M exporter to render milestone lists in canonical
order. Pure functions — no I/O, no persistence side-effects — so
they're safe to invoke at any layer (CLI, REST, OSCAL emit, test
fixtures).

Cycle-diff intent:

The CONMON cycle calendar (v0.9.0 P3) reads "what's coming due in
the next 30 days?" + "what's overdue right now?" off this module's
:func:`upcoming_milestones` + :func:`derive_attention_state` helpers.
Until P3 lands, those questions are answered by the CLI's
``poam list --upcoming N`` flag.

    The CLI displays an 8-char milestone-id prefix in ``poam show``,
    ``poam milestone add``, and ``poam calendar`` output (``(3f70eae3)``).
    Operators copy that prefix and pass it back to ``poam milestone
    update``; this resolver lets a unique prefix round-trip to the
    full UUID so the displayed id is actually usable.

    Resolution order (within ``item.poam_milestones`` only):

      1. **Exact full-id match** wins (``m.id == partial``) — the
         pre-existing behaviour, unchanged.
      2. Otherwise, if ``partial`` is a prefix of EXACTLY ONE
         milestone's id, resolve to that milestone's full id.
      3. A prefix matching MULTIPLE milestones raises
         :class:`AmbiguousMilestoneIdError`.
      4. A prefix matching NONE raises :class:`MilestoneNotFoundError`.

    Args:
        item: The POA&M item (``ControlGap``) whose ``poam_milestones``
            collection scopes the lookup. Prefix uniqueness is judged
            within this item only — two different POA&M items may carry
            milestones sharing a prefix without ambiguity.
        partial: The full UUID or a leading substring of one.

    Returns:
        The full milestone id (``Milestone.id``) of the single match.

    Raises:
        AmbiguousMilestoneIdError: ``partial`` is a prefix of two or
            more milestones on ``item``.
