"""OSCAL schema-version constant (v0.9.6 P4.2).

Single source of truth for the OSCAL schema version Evidentia emits
in catalog / profile / assessment-results / plan-of-action-and-
milestones / system-security-plan metadata blocks.

Lives in its own module to break the circular import that would
otherwise arise from the per-emitter modules
(:mod:`evidentia_core.oscal.exporter`,
:mod:`evidentia_core.oscal.poam_exporter`,
:mod:`evidentia_core.oscal.profile`) importing from the package
``__init__.py`` while the package itself re-exports those modules.

Bumping this constant + handling any field renames at the emit
sites is the canonical path for OSCAL minor-version upgrades.
