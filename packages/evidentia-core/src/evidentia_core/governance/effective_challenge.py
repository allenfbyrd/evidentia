"""Effective Challenge primitives (v0.7.10 P1.5 G2).

SR 11-7 §III.D + SR 26-02 / OCC Bulletin 2026-13a explicitly require
"effective challenge" of model assumptions, methodology, and results
by parties independent of model development. Challenge events must
be DOCUMENTED, including who challenged, when, on what grounds, and
what the outcome was.

This module ships the documentation primitive — operators can log
challenge events as structured records via the
:class:`EffectiveChallenge` schema. Each record links back to a
:class:`evidentia_core.models.model_risk.ModelInventory` entry so
the challenge history flows directly from the model inventory.

Companion sibling module ``evidentia_core.governance.lines_of_
defense`` (v0.7.10 P1.5 G1) provides the 3LOD classification
that determines whether a challenger is "independent enough" —
typically a 2nd-line (risk/compliance) or 3rd-line (internal
audit) party challenging a 1st-line (business operations) model
owner.
