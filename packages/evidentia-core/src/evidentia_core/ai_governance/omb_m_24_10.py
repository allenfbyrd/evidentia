"""OMB M-24-10 AI impact categorization (v0.9.6 P3).

`OMB Memorandum M-24-10 <https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/M-24-10-Advancing-Governance-Innovation-and-Risk-Management-for-Agency-Use-of-Artificial-Intelligence.pdf>`_
(March 28, 2024) directs federal agencies to inventory AI use cases
and apply minimum risk-management practices to systems that affect
public rights or safety. The memo defines three impact categories
that gate the obligation level:

  - **Rights-Impacting AI** (§5(b)(i)): outputs have legal, material,
    binding, or similarly significant effects on individuals or
    communities. Examples per OMB §5(b): law enforcement, eligibility
    determinations for benefits, hiring / admissions, immigration /
    border adjudications, public health / medical determinations.

  - **Safety-Impacting AI** (§5(b)(ii)): applications that could create
    or exacerbate physical or safety risks. Examples per OMB §5(b):
    safety-critical infrastructure controls, autonomous vehicles,
    medical-device decisions.

  - **Neither**: no rights / safety impact. Subject to baseline
    governance practices but exempt from the §5(c) minimum
    risk-management requirements.

The fourth value, **Rights and Safety-Impacting**, captures systems
hitting BOTH §5(b)(i) and §5(b)(ii) — common in federal AI deployed
to medical / public-health contexts where the same output is both a
medical determination (rights-impacting) AND a safety-relevant signal
(safety-impacting). Evidentia surfaces this as a first-class category
rather than asking operators to pick "the more salient" trigger.

**Threat-model boundary**: this is operator-supplied metadata, not
a control surface. Misclassification is an operator risk; Evidentia
surfaces the category for inventory + reporting but does NOT validate
it against the system's actual use case. Federal agencies have a
legal review path (typically the Chief AI Officer or General Counsel)
that determines the categorization.

**Inventory schema reference**: there is no upstream-published
machine-readable schema for M-24-10 inventory entries. Federal
agencies (Federal Reserve, EXIM, SBA, DOJ, VA, EEOC) publish their
own compliance plans in prose form. Evidentia defines the canonical
JSON / Pydantic representation here so cross-agency tooling has a
shared schema to target.
