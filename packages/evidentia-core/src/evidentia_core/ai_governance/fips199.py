"""FIPS 199 categorization for federal AI systems (v0.9.6 P3).

`FIPS PUB 199 <https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/199/final>`_ defines
the standardized impact categorization scheme for federal information
+ federal information systems along three security objectives:

  - **Confidentiality**: unauthorized disclosure impact
  - **Integrity**: unauthorized modification impact
  - **Availability**: disruption-of-access impact

Each objective is rated LOW / MODERATE / HIGH per FIPS 199 §3 +
the worked examples in NIST SP 800-60 Vol 1 + Vol 2. The
**overall categorization** follows the "high-water-mark" rule per
FIPS 199 §3: ``overall = max(confidentiality, integrity, availability)``.

This module ships as a v0.9.6 federal-compliance carry-over from the
v0.9.5 walk-through validation queue. The categorization fields slot
into :class:`evidentia_core.ai_governance.registry.AISystemRegistryEntry`
as an Optional sub-model (backward-compat with v0.9.3–v0.9.5 entries
that pre-date federal-tier inventory expectations).

Operators populating FIPS 199 fields typically have an upstream
NIST SP 800-60 reference (the published worked-examples mapping
information-type → impact level). Evidentia does not maintain that
mapping itself — operators supply the per-objective rating based
on their SSP / authorization documentation.

**Threat-model boundary**: FIPS 199 ratings are operator-supplied
metadata, not a control surface. Misclassification is an operator
risk (under-rated systems may bypass required controls); Evidentia
surfaces the field for downstream OSCAL emit + reporting but does
NOT validate the rating against the information-types the system
processes (that's the operator's NIST SP 800-60 review).
