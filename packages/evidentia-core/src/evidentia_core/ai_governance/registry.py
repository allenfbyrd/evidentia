"""AI system inventory data model (v0.9.3 P2.4 + v0.9.6 P3 federal expansion).

Pydantic models for registering AI systems in the operator's
governance inventory. Each entry links a descriptor to its
classification + deployment status + responsible operator.

Storage lives in :mod:`evidentia_core.ai_governance.registry_store`
(JSON file-backed; mirrors v0.7.9 vendor_store + v0.9.0 poam_store
pattern).

v0.9.6 P3 adds four optional fields aligning the registry with
federal-tier inventory expectations:

- :class:`FIPS199Categorization` — operator-supplied impact rating
- :class:`ATOReference` — link to the parent system's Authorization
  to Operate decision
- ``ssp_reference`` — URI / handle pointing at the System Security
  Plan document
- :class:`OMBImpactCategory` — OMB M-24-10 Rights / Safety
  classification

All four fields are Optional → backward-compat with v0.9.3 – v0.9.5
entries that pre-date the federal expansion.
