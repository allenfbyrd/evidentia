"""Per-finding and per-run provenance metadata (v0.7.0+).

Implements checklist items H5 (collector metadata on every finding),
H10 (pagination continuation tokens preserved as evidence), and B5
(completeness attestation). Designed to satisfy:

- NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 AU-2(d) / AU-3 / AU-6(4) — audit records must
  identify the user, process, resource, outcome, and timing of each
  evidence-generating action.
- ISAE 3402 / SSAE 18 AT-C 320 — auditors expect to trace every piece
  of evidence back to the collecting process, credential, and scope.
- FedRAMP CA-7 (Continuous Monitoring) — evidence collection scope
  must be documented and verifiable on demand.

Public classes:

- :class:`CollectionContext` is embedded on every finding. Redundant
  across findings from the same run, but stays with each finding if
  the payload is split, filtered, or re-exported. Chain-of-custody
  survives transformations.
- :class:`CollectionManifest` is one-per-run, attached to the OSCAL AR
  document's ``metadata.props`` and written as an optional sibling
  file. Captures coverage, filters, record counts, and — crucially —
  explicit empty-set attestations so a reviewer can distinguish
  "no findings" from "collection never ran" or "collection crashed".
- :class:`GenerationContext` (v0.7.1) is the AI-output sibling of
  :class:`CollectionContext`. Risk statements and plain-English control
  explanations are *generated* (not collected from a source system) and
  carry distinct provenance — model, temperature, prompt hash, retry
  count — so an auditor can reproduce or challenge an AI-derived claim.
