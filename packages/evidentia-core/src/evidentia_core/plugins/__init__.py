"""Evidentia plugin contracts (v0.8.0 P0.4).

Four extension surfaces for out-of-tree authors to ship custom
implementations without forking core:

- ``AuthProvider`` (auth) — pluggable authentication backends for
  ``evidentia serve`` (token files, OAuth, mTLS, etc.)
- ``StorageBackend`` (storage) — pluggable persistence for gap
  reports, collector findings, and audit-relevant records
  (filesystem, S3, IPFS, etc.)
- ``MarketplaceProvider`` (marketplace) — pluggable OSCAL catalog
  providers (local directory, community CDN mirror, IBM
  compliance-trestle registry, organization-private registries)
- ``BaseSaaSCollector`` (collectors) — common SaaS-collector
  scaffolding (auth + httpx client + pagination + error-
  translation) for the v0.7.9 vendor-risk collectors (Vanta /
  Drata / BitSight / SecurityScorecard) and any future SaaS
  collectors. Closes the v0.7.13-cycle M-4 follow-up.

Each contract is an ``abc.ABC`` with abstractmethods that
implementers must provide. The contracts ship with at least
one OSS reference implementation per type (see the ``local_*``
or ``file_backend`` modules under each contract package) so
authors have a working shape to copy.

Discovery is via the ``evidentia.plugins`` entry-point group
in ``importlib.metadata.entry_points``. See ``docs/extending.md``
for the canonical author guide.

The contracts are designed for OSS-justified personas:

- **Community catalog providers** — someone hosts an OSCAL
  catalog mirror (a local-language catalog set, a community
  CDN, etc.) and wants Evidentia users to fetch from it
- **SI partners** — an SI delivery contract needs a private
  storage backend specific to a federal customer's environment
  (e.g., on-prem NFS, AWS GovCloud S3, etc.)
- **Extension authors** — someone maintains an out-of-tree
  collector for a niche cloud and wants the same audit-trail
  + error-translation conventions Evidentia's bundled
  collectors use

The contracts do NOT depend on any commercial-tier vocabulary.
They are designed for OSS-only consumption.

def discover_plugins(group: str = "evidentia.plugins") -> dict[str, object]:
    """Discover registered plugins via ``importlib.metadata``.

    Args:
        group: The entry-point group to query. Defaults to
            ``evidentia.plugins`` per the Evidentia convention.

    Returns:
        Mapping of entry-point name → loaded plugin object.

    Example:
        Out-of-tree plugin authors register their plugin in their
        package's ``pyproject.toml``::

            [project.entry-points."evidentia.plugins"]
            my-storage = "my_package.my_storage:MyStorageBackend"

        At runtime, Evidentia loads them via::

            from evidentia_core.plugins import discover_plugins

            plugins = discover_plugins()
            for name, plugin in plugins.items():
                if isinstance(plugin, type) and issubclass(plugin, StorageBackend):
                    register_storage_backend(name, plugin)

    The default behavior is opt-in (callers explicitly invoke
    ``discover_plugins()``); Evidentia's default runtime does
    not auto-discover plugins. This keeps the trust posture
    explicit: operators choose to enable third-party plugins.
