"""Re-validate every claimed-PASS evidence link in ``OSPS-CONFORMANCE.md``.

Extracted (v0.10.7, D2.3) from the embedded ``python <<'PY'`` heredoc in
``.github/workflows/verify-osps-conformance.yml`` so the URL-translation
logic can be unit-tested directly (the prior heredoc-in-YAML shape blocked
pytest coverage — Issue #2 from the C3 review / the ``TODO(v0.10.7)``
marker in the workflow). Behavior is preserved exactly: same regexes, same
``translate_url`` rules, same hard-fail-on-unmapped-shape semantics, same
404 detection, same exit codes, same ``GH_TOKEN`` usage.

What it does
------------
1. Parse ``OSPS-CONFORMANCE.md`` for table rows of the form
   ``| OSPS-XX-NN | <title> | OK PASS | [text](URL) ... |`` (the PASS
   marker is the U+2705 check-mark glyph).
2. For each cited evidence URL, translate the GitHub HTML-render URL into
   the corresponding REST API endpoint (which returns a clean 404 on a
   missing resource, unlike the HTML renderer which can 200-OK a missing
   path).
3. Call ``gh api`` for each endpoint; collect any HTTP 404.
4. Exit non-zero if any evidence link 404s OR if any URL shape has no
   translation rule (an unmapped shape is a silent-PASS hazard — the
   SF-2 failure mode this gate exists to close).

Threat model: see ``docs/threat-model.md`` ->  "v0.10.6 attack-surface
delta" ->  "Guards: verify-osps-conformance.yml workflow".

Exit codes
----------
- ``0`` — all PASS-claimed evidence links resolved.
- ``1`` — one or more evidence links 404'd, OR one or more URL shapes had
  no translation rule, OR no PASS-claimed controls were parsed at all
  (table-format drift).
- ``2`` — ``OSPS-CONFORMANCE.md`` not found.

Security note: evidence URLs are passed to ``gh api`` only as
``subprocess.run`` positional arguments (an argument list, never a shell
string), blocking workflow-injection from doc content.

Per the publishing-authority protocol (~/.claude/CLAUDE.md), this script
is read-only — it never edits, pushes, tags, or publishes.

    """Return ``(api_endpoint, shape_label)`` for a doc URL.

    The ``api_endpoint`` is suitable to pass directly as a ``gh api``
    positional argument (no scheme — ``gh api`` prepends api.github.com).
    The ``shape_label`` is for diagnostic annotations.

    WHY each shape maps the way it does: GitHub's HTML renderer can return
    HTTP 200 with a "Page Not Found" body for paths under a public repo
    even when the file does NOT exist on ``main`` HEAD (depending on auth
    state + caching layer behavior). The REST endpoints below are the
    documented "does this resource exist" checks and return a clean 404.

    URL shapes that DON'T match any translation rule return the
    ``"unmapped"`` label — the caller treats that as a HARD FAILURE (not a
    warning), forcing every URL shape used in OSPS-CONFORMANCE.md to have
    an explicit translation entry here. The previous ``::warning::``-and-
    pass fallback re-introduced the SF-2 failure mode (``gh api`` against
    the HTML URL 200-OKs from GitHub's renderer even when the underlying
    resource is missing). New URL shapes MUST be added to ``translate_url``
    before they're cited as evidence.
