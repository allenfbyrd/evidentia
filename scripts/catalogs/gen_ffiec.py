"""Generate FFIEC IT Examination Handbook bundled catalogs (v0.7.10 P1).

Authoritative source: <https://ithandbook.ffiec.gov/>. The FFIEC IT
Examination Handbook is published by the Federal Financial
Institutions Examination Council (a US federal interagency body
encompassing OCC + FRB + FDIC + NCUA + CFPB + State Liaison
Committee) and is **public domain** — works of the US federal
government are not eligible for copyright per 17 USC §105, and
inter-agency examination handbooks are explicitly classed as such.

This generator emits Tier A control catalogs for one of the 5
booklets in the FFIEC IT Handbook stack. The other 4 booklets
(Information Security / Audit / Management / Operations / plus
this one — Outsourcing Technology Services) follow the same
pattern; the v0.7.10 P1 first slice ships only the Outsourcing
booklet to establish the shape, with the remaining 4 + the FFIEC
Cybersecurity Assessment Tool + the OCC/SR 26-02 model-risk
catalog deferred to follow-up P1 sub-batches.

Cadence: each booklet is published ~once per several years; the
v0.7.10 manifest pins the 2004-published Outsourcing booklet which
remains the active examination guidance (last revised June 2004
plus 2008 + 2010 supplements; FFIEC has not retired it).
