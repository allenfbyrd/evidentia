"""Generate OCC Bulletin 2026-13a / FRB SR 26-02 model-risk catalog.

Authoritative source: OCC Bulletin 2026-13a + FRB SR 26-02
("Supervisory Guidance on Model Risk Management"), April 17, 2026
supersession of OCC Bulletin 2011-12 / FRB SR 11-7.

Public domain — works of US federal government per 17 USC §105.

The 2026 guidance carries forward the SR 11-7 framework structure:
§II Model definition + materiality, §III Model Development +
Implementation + Use (Conceptual Soundness + Outcomes Analysis +
Validation), §IV Validation requirements + cadence, §V Vendor
Models, §VI Governance.

The 2026 supersession **explicitly excludes generative AI and
agentic AI from scope**. Banks deploying LLM-driven controls
operate without a regulatory framework — Evidentia's
GenerationContext provenance chain (v0.7.1) + the v0.7.10 P0.6.4
RiskStatement.model_inventory_ref linkage produce SR-replacement-
grade audit evidence for those deployments. See
docs/financial-sector-overlay.md "GenAI regulator-vacuum
positioning" + docs/positioning-and-value.md §4.6.
