"""Generate the README "Recent Releases" block from CHANGELOG.md.

Evidentia v0.10.7 Phase E5a. The README's ``## Recent Releases`` section
is a hand-maintained mirror of the newest CHANGELOG entries; it drifted
stale across the v0.10.x line (e.g. shipping v0.10.7 while the README
still listed v0.10.6/5/4). This script makes the block a *generated*
artifact so it can never lag the project version again.

THE CONTRACT (CHANGELOG -> README)
==================================

CHANGELOG.md is the source of truth. It carries one block per release:

    ## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD

    **Theme**: *<theme phrase>*. <prose...>

    **Release summary**: <prose...>

    ### Added
    - <bullet>
    ...

This generator:

  1. Parses every ``## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`` heading (newest first as they
     appear top-to-bottom; the ``[Unreleased]`` block has no date and is
     skipped).
  2. Takes the top 3 dated blocks.
  3. For each, emits ONE README entry in the existing house style::

         **vX.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)** — *<condensed theme>*. <condensed summary>.

     - the *theme* comes from the block's ``**Theme**:`` line, stripped of
       its leading ``vX.Y.Z —`` self-prefix and normalized (em dashes ->
       commas; trailing period dropped).
     - the *summary* is condensed from the block's leading ``### Added``
       bullets (their first sentence each), capped to keep the entry to the
       ~1-3 sentence length of the surrounding entries.
  4. Replaces ONLY the text between the ``## Recent Releases`` header line
     and the ``Full release history:`` line in README.md. Everything else
     in the README is left byte-for-byte untouched.

``--check`` MODE (the pre-tag staleness guard)
==============================================

``gen_readme_releases.py --check`` exits non-zero unless the README
Recent-Releases block has EXACTLY 3 entries AND the newest entry's version
equals the current project version (read from
``packages/evidentia-core/pyproject.toml``). This is wired into the
``check_docs_health.py`` ``readme_recent_releases_current`` invariant so a
release can't ship with a stale README releases list.

Deterministic, stdlib-only. The auto-condensed prose is intended to be
README-quality on its own; if a particular release's CHANGELOG phrasing
condenses awkwardly, hand-edit the generated block and (optionally) tighten
the condensation heuristics here — the ``--check`` guard only asserts count
+ newest-version, not exact prose, so hand-polish survives re-runs as long
as the count and newest version stay correct.

Exit codes:
    0 — write mode: block written (or already current). check mode: PASS.
    1 — check mode: block is stale (wrong count or newest != current).
    2 — IO / parse error (CHANGELOG or README missing/malformed).

Usage:
    python scripts/gen_readme_releases.py            # rewrite README block
    python scripts/gen_readme_releases.py --check     # staleness guard
    python scripts/gen_readme_releases.py --print      # print block to stdout
